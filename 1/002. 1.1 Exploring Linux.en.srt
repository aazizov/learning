00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,070
- Before we get started

2
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:10,020
let's talk a bit about Linux.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,390
Linux is an open source operating system

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,160
that is based on UNIX

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,080
and UNIX was the leading operating system

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,830
in the 1970s, 80s and 90s.

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,710
As UNIX was mainly used
for servers in companies,

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,610
expensive licenses needed to
be purchased for using it.

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,240
And by being open source, Linux
provides a free alternative

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,193
to UNIX, with the same look and feel.

11
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,120
Open source is a software
development model,

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,670
where the source code used
to compile software programs

13
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,063
is not proprietary and secret,
but accessible to anyone.

14
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,840
An open source has proved
to be very successful

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,660
as a development model,
as anyone can analyze

16
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,673
the source code and contribute to it.

17
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,870
Open source software
leads to free software

18
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,210
and that is free as in freedom of mind,

19
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,563
not as in free beer.

20
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,490
Companies can bundle open source software

21
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,910
which support licenses and
still charge for their product.

22
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,430
One major requirement
in open source software

23
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,590
is that most licenses
require the source code

24
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,590
to remain accessible to
everyone at all times.

25
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,300
But how about support?

26
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,200
Well, for use in companies,
support on software is essential

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,200
and support is available
at different levels.

28
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,840
You can think of help
if anything goes wrong

29
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,730
or support by hardware vendors

30
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,140
who will be able to help you

31
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,810
according to their support contracts

32
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,900
or support by application
vendors who will support

33
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,310
their main applications on top

34
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,100
of the supporting operating systems.

35
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,580
As you can guess, support is
essential for being successful

36
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,218
in an enterprise environment.

37
00:01:44,218 --> 00:01:46,470
But Linux is free, and for that reason

38
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,750
it does not come with
support automatically,

39
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:49,983
because who owns it?

40
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,970
Well, that is where Enterprise
Linux distributions come in

41
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,830
like Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

42
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,360
And they differentiate themselves

43
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,670
by providing a support offering.

44
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,273
While working with Linux, there
are different distributions.

45
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,690
Linux itself is an operating
system that is made

46
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,850
from a software collection that includes

47
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,823
the Linux kernel, and
additional software components.

48
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,120
And the additional software
components are developed

49
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,790
as individual open source projects.

50
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:20,010
And you could gather all
the components yourself

51
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,950
and combine them into a
working operating system

52
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,450
but that's a lot of work.

53
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:27,660
And that is why Linux distributions
are doing that for you.

54
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,420
And they provide an
installer, a package manager

55
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,280
and other components to make it easy

56
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,903
to get started with Linux.

57
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,970
Now that you know a little bit

58
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,530
about the background of Linux,

59
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,873
let's talk about Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
