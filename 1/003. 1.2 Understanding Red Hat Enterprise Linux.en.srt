00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,030
- Now that we know about
the backgrounds of Linux,

2
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,720
let's talk about Red Hat
Enterprise Linux specifically.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,060
Red Hat Enterprise Linux or RHEL

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,343
is the leading Linux distribution.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,570
It started in 1993 as a Linux distribution

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,980
and it was amongst the first

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,933
to offer support for their software.

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,690
And because of the software offering,

9
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,430
Red Hat Enterprise Linux currently

10
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,470
is the most successful Linux distribution

11
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,793
for use in companies.

12
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,550
A new major version of RHEL

13
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,610
is released approximately every four years

14
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,133
and the current major
version of RHEL is nine.

15
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,130
During the live time of a major version,

16
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,930
minor updates are provided,

17
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,420
typically, in six to nine-month intervals,

18
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,690
but that depends if software requires it.

19
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,780
Big changes are introduced
only in major versions

20
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,020
and minor versions don't
see any big changes.

21
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,870
And while a new version
of RHEL is introduced,

22
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,000
the previous versions, normally,

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,073
are still supported for quite some time.

24
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,100
You can check this website

25
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,020
for the current RHEL support policy

26
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,813
because that tends to
change every now and then.
