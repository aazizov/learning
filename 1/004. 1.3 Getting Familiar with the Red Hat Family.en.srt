1
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,620
- Being open source, Red Hat
doesn't stand all by itself.

2
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,130
Red Hat participates in
many open source projects.

3
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,990
And one of these is Fedora

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,203
a free community distribution
that is sponsored by Red Hat.

5
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:24,330
Mature packages from Fedora
are included in CentOS stream

6
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,720
and CentOS stream is the
upstream project for RHEL ,

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,910
where community developers can participate

8
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,370
and contribute new software.

9
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:34,620
RHEL is derived from CentOS stream

10
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,840
and it offers an Enterprise
Linux distribution

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,133
which support options.

12
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,090
Rocky Linux And Alma Linux
are derived from Red Hat

13
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,303
Enterprise Linux as free
community alternatives.

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,510
Let's talk a bit about Fedora.

15
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,460
Fedora is a community project

16
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,960
which is sponsored by redhead.

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,930
The focus in Fedora is on the latest

18
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,173
and greatest developments
and not so much on stability.

19
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,160
Fedora has a 12 to 18 months life cycle

20
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,890
and no support options are available.

21
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,430
A new version is typically
released every six months

22
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,320
and Fedora is an awesome solution

23
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,400
if you want to be ahead

24
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,403
of the changes and run
Linux or modern hardware.

25
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,340
Then there is CentOS stream,
CentOS stream is extremely

26
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,350
important in the development life cycle

27
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,580
of RHEL, because it is the
upstream development platform.

28
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,710
And that means that new changes will occur

29
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,447
in CentOS stream before
being implemented in RHEL.

30
00:01:32,447 --> 00:01:34,800
CentOS stream is based
on software that comes

31
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,020
from the Fedora project,

32
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,760
in which has reached a stable state.

33
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,703
And it has an expected
life cycle of five years.

34
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,900
Due to its ever evolving
nature, CentOS to stream is not

35
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,640
a recommended distribution to use

36
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,040
in production environments.

37
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,150
And then there is RHEL, RHEL
is Red Hat Enterprise Linux

38
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,850
which is a supported Linux
distribution that is offered

39
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,683
for used by organizations.

40
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,100
It has a life cycle of 10 years.

41
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,770
And it offers support on the software.

42
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,470
It integrates in the
Red Hat product family,

43
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,320
where additional expertise,
security, certification,

44
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,413
and monitoring can be offered
through different products.

45
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,640
You can also use it unsupported for free,

46
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,690
up to 16 instances of Red Hat
Enterprise Linux are available

47
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,830
through developer.RedHat.com

48
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,600
Then there are also Rocky
Linux and Alma Linux,

49
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,200
which will be considered
part of the Red Hat family.

50
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,860
Before 2019, CentOS was a
free alternative to Red Hat

51
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,430
Enterprise Linux, where all
Red Hat proprietary elements

52
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,050
were removed.

53
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,000
And nowadays, CentOS stream has

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,760
become the only version
of CentOS and it serves

55
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,650
as an upstream for RHEL.

56
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:50,133
So the old way that CentOS was
used does not exist anymore.

57
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,390
Rocky Linux was created as
an answer by the original

58
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,430
founders of the CentOS project

59
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,740
who thought that the
free Red Hat alternative

60
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,883
should be available.

61
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:03,210
Alma Linux had the same idea in mind,

62
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,673
and Alma was created by cloud Linux.

63
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,650
But, as Red Hat offer up to
16 instances of RHEL for free,

64
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,300
the need for free distributions

65
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,423
like Alma and Rocky is not
as big as it used to be.

66
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,590
Now let's talk a bit about RHEL versions.

67
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,690
Red Hat Enterprise Linux is a foundation

68
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,150
for some other products as well.

69
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,710
Like a Red Hat CoreOS

70
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,620
which is an image based
container host that is used

71
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,900
in OpenShift environments.

72
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,210
Or Red Hat universal based image,

73
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:37,020
or UBI, which is a subset of
RHEL packages that can be used

74
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,993
as a foundation for building
custom container images.

75
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,740
Now that you know about
the backgrounds of RHEL

76
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,290
let's talk about how to get it.
