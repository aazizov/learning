1
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:07,223
- All right.

2
00:00:07,223 --> 00:00:10,080
So here we are on developers.redhat.com.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,603
And in order to get
access, you need to log in.

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,910
So here we have the login to
your Red Hat account window.

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,970
Enter your account credentials

6
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,100
or you create a new account

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,680
using register for Red Hat account.

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,710
Also, you can use either of these options

9
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,730
like LinkedIn and Twitter
and Facebook and GitHub

10
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:37,320
as an external authentication
provider and login with that.

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,853
And then you click next.

12
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,760
So next, you enter your password.

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,700
You click login, and that
should give you access.

14
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,890
And, oh, here we can see

15
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,890
that Red Hat requires a
little bit more information.

16
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,943
These are privacy related settings.

17
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,113
So select whatever you want
and continue with that.

18
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,210
So now, I am logged in,
and I can start using.

19
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:08,760
So, we need to go to the products.

20
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,603
And in the products, there
is Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

21
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,960
And in Red Hat Enterprise Linux,

22
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,710
you can just click
download RHEL 9 for free.

23
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,240
So you click it.

24
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,920
So after clicking,

25
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,730
you can see all the
downloads that are available.

26
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:31,730
And what you wanna have, well,
it's typically the big one

27
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:38,120
which is right here, the
X86_64, eight gigabytes,

28
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,320
ISO image, that contains all
the software that you need.

29
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,550
Notice that these images
are for different platforms.

30
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:51,210
Most people probably need X86_64.

31
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,310
Alternatively, if that doesn't work

32
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,770
because of platform computability issues,

33
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,920
you can select AARCH64.

34
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,320
This is just about the
supporting platform,

35
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,870
the computing platform
that you are going to use.

36
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:07,920
It doesn't change anything in
the functionality of Linux.

37
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,440
So click download,
it'll start downloading.

38
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,060
And once it is done,

39
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,943
you are good to continue
and start installing it.
