1
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,240
- All right, so now that
we know a little bit

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,480
about the background of
Red Hat Enterprise Linux,

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,060
let's talk about how to get it.

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,120
Supported and paid for
instances of RHEL are offered

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,200
through redhat.com or
the partner ecosystem.

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,740
That means you need to buy
it before getting it there,

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,470
but there's also
unsupported developer access

8
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:33,090
to many Red Hat products
through developers.redhat.com.

9
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,330
And that is what I recommend
that you use for this course.

10
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:40,890
So as a developer, but really
as anyone you can run up

11
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,170
16 instances of RHEL for free.

12
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,730
You do not have to be a developer.

13
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,040
Nobody is checking if you are a developer.

14
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,100
If you just wanna learn
Red Hat Enterprise Linux,

15
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,730
you can use the developers
account as well.

16
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,850
As an alternative there's
also one free evaluation copy

17
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,060
of RHEL that can be obtained
through access.redhat.com.

18
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,730
But really there's no reason to use it

19
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,800
because you can get it for for free

20
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,153
on developers.redhat.com.
