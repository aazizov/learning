00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,120
- All right, now that we are
at the end of this lesson,

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,380
let's do a lab.

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,380
Make sure that new
users require a password

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,440
with a maximum validity of 90 days.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,180
Ensure that while creating users,

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,520
an empty fell with the name newfile

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,650
is created to their home directory.

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,110
Create users anna,
audrey, linda, and lisa.

9
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,750
Set the passwords for anna
and audrey to 'password'

10
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,003
and disable the passwords
for linda and lisa.

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,140
Finally, create groups profs and students

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,750
and make users anna and
audrey members of profs

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,420
and linda and lisa members of students

14
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,623
as a secondary group.
