00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,970
- The last thing that you
need to know about users

2
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,590
is how to manage passwords.

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,170
So, let's talk about passwords.

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:18,170
Passwords are stored in an
encrypted way, in etc shadow.

5
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,220
There, you will find an encrypted string

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,850
and this encrypted string shows
three pieces of information

7
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,890
the hashing algorithm that was used,

8
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,060
the random salt,

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,790
and the encrypted hash
of the user password.

10
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,010
But Hey, do you really
need to know about it?

11
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:33,720
No, This is nice to know.

12
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,850
If you think that in etc shadow

13
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,550
the password is stored
in an encrypted way,

14
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,250
as long as you know that, then we're good.

15
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,530
Now, how do we manage password settings?

16
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,420
Basic password requirements

17
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,860
as we have already seen a set

18
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,200
in etc, login, or defs.

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,390
For advanced password properties,

20
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,140
you can use Pluggable
Authentication Models, or (PAM).

21
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,060
in Pam you have a model

22
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,180
the pam faillock model,
but that's nice to know.

23
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,700
We don't have to further
investigate how that is working

24
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,143
for our HCSA.

25
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,290
To change password
settings for current users,

26
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,880
use change or passwd, but
make sure that you are root.

27
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,963
Let's check it out.

28
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:19,470
So let's change user, change Bob

29
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,210
which is showing what?

30
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,000
This is very convenient,
it's going interactive

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,130
and that's exactly what
I would advise you to do

32
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,740
in case you have to do
stuff like this on the exam.

33
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,510
You don't have to think about anything

34
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,040
just follow the prompt.

35
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,600
Minimum password age,

36
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,450
Well, Bob should use the
password for three days

37
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:37,410
at least.

38
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,930
Maximum password age, seven.

39
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,550
I want it to be secure.

40
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,860
So every seven days, yes, that's right.

41
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,560
This user will change their password.

42
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,570
Last password change is
something that we don't

43
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,013
have to, to change.

44
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,210
It's normally set to the
day the user was created

45
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,250
if this is a brand new user.

46
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,170
Password expiration warning

47
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,360
one day is enough, seven days

48
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,610
if the maximum password age is seven

49
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,530
that doesn't make sense.

50
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,020
Password inactive is minus one.

51
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,450
So the password is not currently inactive.

52
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:12,360
And we do want an account expiration date.

53
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,350
So 2022-12-12

54
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,180
looks like a nice day to me.

55
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,560
And there we go.

56
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,400
User Bob has its password
settings changed.

57
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,570
So change minus minus
help is showing what?

58
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,620
Well, this is showing

59
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,450
that there is a minus L option

60
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,820
in order to verify you can use it.

61
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,130
So change minus L on Bob.

62
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,090
And there we go.

63
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,200
We nicely see all of the
parameters that we have just set.

64
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,210
And that's about all
that you need to know.

65
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,460
Passwd can do the same thing, but Hey

66
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,100
why would you wanna know
about two different commands?

67
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,600
If you can do all of the job

68
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,490
with just one command.

69
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,373
That's all, let's continue
with the end of lesson lab.
