1
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,470
- All right, so let's start
with the password option

2
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,570
which is the login.defs.

3
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:13,890
We already talked about it,

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,440
so I just have to change the 99 to 90

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,093
to match the requirement here.

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,810
Next, we need to make
sure that the new files

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,030
are created to the home directory.

8
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,780
So touch/etc/skel/newfile,

9
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,270
anything in etc skel will be copied

10
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,890
to the user home directory.

11
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,220
It's mainly for configuration files

12
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,113
for the bash shell environment.

13
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,730
Then we need to create users,
anna, audrey, linda and lisa.

14
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,720
So useradd anna, do I have to do that?

15
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,518
No, we already have an anna.

16
00:00:47,518 --> 00:00:51,630
Useradd audrey, that's the
user that I don't have yet.

17
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,760
How about linda?

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,320
Well, we can just try it.

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,740
We get an error if the user
already exists and that's okay.

20
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,560
We just need to make sure
that users are there.

21
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,890
Set password for anna
and audrey to password.

22
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,240
Let me do something funny.

23
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,240
Echo password pipe
passwd minus minus stdin

24
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,650
which is taking the password out of a pipe

25
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,650
for user anna and also for user audrey.

26
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,120
This is not a very secure option

27
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,150
because if you don't do anything,
it will be kept in memory.

28
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,430
But this is definitely something cool

29
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,990
for automated solutions.

30
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,570
Now we need to disable the passwords

31
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,310
for user linda and lisa.

32
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,580
Did you know that you can
also do that using passwd?

33
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,290
We have seen that with usermod

34
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,780
but I'm going to use passwd.

35
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,730
Lock the password for the named account.

36
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:45,990
That's what we need.

37
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,580
So passwd minus l linda will lock you,

38
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,643
so linda and lisa will be locked as well.

39
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,920
Then finally, we need to create
the group profs and students

40
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,350
and make user anna and
audrey members of profs

41
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,810
and linda and lisa members of student.

42
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,840
So groupadd profs

43
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,440
and groupadd students.

44
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,960
And then what was this nice option again?

45
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,700
Groupadd minus minus help.

46
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,440
Hey everybody, this is really something

47
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,080
that I would recommend to
do on the exam as well.

48
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,700
On the exam, you will have these moments

49
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,770
where you think, oh, what
was this option again?

50
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:23,970
You don't remember.

51
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,290
That's no problem.

52
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,290
Just use minus minus help, so
that we see groupadd minus u

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,110
anna and audrey

54
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:39,843
on profs.

55
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,630
Oops, did I really do
a groupadd? My mistake.

56
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,250
That should be a groupmod.

57
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,753
But hey, it's convenient to see

58
00:02:48,753 --> 00:02:51,090
that groupadd can use the same options.

59
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:56,090
And now let me do an lid
on profs to figure out

60
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,803
which users are a member.

61
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:06,480
And next, let me use
an lid minus g on profs

62
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,580
to verify that this worked out all right.

63
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,720
And yeah, it did.

64
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,730
And now we can do it right from the start.

65
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:16,730
Groupmod minus U lisa
and linda on students

66
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:23,150
and lid minus g students

67
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,380
and what do we see?

68
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,900
We see the members of this group

69
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,510
and that is how you
could have done this lap.

70
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,030
Of course, different
solutions are possible,

71
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,180
but in the end the only thing
that matters is the result

72
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,930
and that's what we have right here.
