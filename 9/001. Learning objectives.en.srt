00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,120
- Hi, welcome to Lesson 9.

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,100
In this lesson, you'll
learn all you need to know

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,650
about managing local user accounts.

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,590
I'll start by explaining
what exactly the purpose is

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,360
of these user accounts.

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,760
And next you'll learn about
setting user properties

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,640
and how to create and
manage user accounts.

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,110
Once you know how to do that,

9
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,050
you'll learn how to
define default settings.

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,820
Then I'll show you what is going on

11
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,940
in /etc/passwd and in /etc/shadow.

12
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:33,900
And after that,

13
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,210
we'll talk about group
membership and groups

14
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,340
as well as password properties.

15
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,360
At the end of this lesson,

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,550
you'll find the lab and the lab solution,

17
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,403
which help you to practice
all of these important skills.
