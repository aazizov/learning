00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,230
- In this video, we'll talk
about user default settings.

2
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,840
The idea is you take care
of the default settings

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,790
before creating your user.

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,643
And that's especially what
you need to do on the exam.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,260
You can use useradd -D to
specify default settings.

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,033
I advise not to do that.

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,430
Also, don't have a look
at /etc/default/useradd

8
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,590
because these are settings
that apply to useradd only.

9
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:32,550
That's pretty useless.

10
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,681
If you want to set user default settings,

11
00:00:34,681 --> 00:00:36,110
you modify the config file,

12
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,370
/etc/login.defs.

13
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,370
Files in /etc/skel are created

14
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,383
to the user home directly upon creation.

15
00:00:43,383 --> 00:00:46,730
So, if you want files to
be created automatically,

16
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,080
have a look at /etc/skel.

17
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,600
All right, now that you know
about these default settings,

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,030
let's have a look at /etc/login.defs

19
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,303
which is the most important
file for user default settings.

20
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:03,630
/etc/login/defs, here we go.

21
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:04,825
What do we have in this file?

22
00:01:04,825 --> 00:01:08,108
We have a couple of important options.

23
00:01:08,108 --> 00:01:11,080
It is a good read because many options

24
00:01:12,461 --> 00:01:15,270
are well annotated and well explained.

25
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,496
But what you definitely need to look at

26
00:01:17,496 --> 00:01:20,700
is what we find right here.

27
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,815
The Pass Max days, 99999.

28
00:01:24,815 --> 00:01:26,580
You know how long that is?

29
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,284
That is 270 years,

30
00:01:28,284 --> 00:01:30,927
count 270 years back.

31
00:01:30,927 --> 00:01:33,450
That was before Napoleon in Europe.

32
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,699
That was before the Civil War in the US.

33
00:01:35,699 --> 00:01:38,710
That was before Buzz
Lightyear landed on the moon.

34
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:41,100
Okay, so let's change this

35
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,115
and let's make it like, 99 for instance.

36
00:01:44,115 --> 00:01:46,740
There's a couple of other options as well,

37
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,610
I do like "Home mode" by the way, 0700.

38
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,030
0700 means that only the user has access

39
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:54,942
to the home directory.

40
00:01:54,942 --> 00:01:59,335
And we can set some other
properties in here as well.

41
00:01:59,335 --> 00:02:02,880
Apart from that, there's
/etc/skel, you know what?

42
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,170
Let me use "touch/etc/skel/hello."

43
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,557
And now, let's do "useradd bill."

44
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,680
And also "passwd bill,"

45
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,840
so that Bill has a password as well.

46
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,890
Going once for the password,
going twice for the password.

47
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,100
And now, we can check
out what has happened.

48
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,250
Well, for users on a Red Hat system

49
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,470
they get a home directory by default.

50
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,840
And if I do an LS on that home directory,

51
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,044
look at that, it has copied
over the file from /etc/skel.

52
00:02:35,044 --> 00:02:39,060
And if I would look up
"user bill" in /etc/passwd

53
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,910
we can see the ordinary
options, not a password one

54
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,830
because the password one
is stored in /etc/shadow

55
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:48,372
but /etc/shadow does contain
a couple of additional options

56
00:02:48,372 --> 00:02:51,060
that I first separately need to explain.

57
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,683
So, let's talk about that later.
