00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:08,490
- In this video, I'll show you

2
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,350
how to create and manage groups.

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,290
So groupadd is the main
command to add groups,

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,640
and guess what you are going to do

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,770
to delete and modify groups?

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,965
Well, you guessed it right,
groupdel and groupmod.

7
00:00:19,965 --> 00:00:22,470
Lid is a convenient command.

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,470
Lid -g on the name of a group

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,530
will list all users that are
members of a specific group,

10
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,570
and that's convenient
because group membership

11
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,390
can be administered in
two different files,

12
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,380
which is etc/group as well as etc/passwd.

13
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,613
Let's go check this out.

14
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,900
So here I have the
command id for user Anna,

15
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,100
and I am going to add a
new group, groupadd sales,

16
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,500
and I want to make sure that user Anna

17
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,300
is a member of the group sales.

18
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,650
Now, how do we do that?

19
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,573
Haha, not groupmod, because groupmod

20
00:00:58,573 --> 00:01:01,230
has a limited number of options.

21
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,640
How are we going to do that?

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,290
Well, groupmod is one thing,

23
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,400
it has its option -U to specify users.

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,730
You can also use usermod - -help,

25
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:16,290
and usermod - -help, this is option G,

26
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,600
but be careful.

27
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,850
G is new list of supplementary groups.

28
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,930
That means that old supplementary
groups are overwritten.

29
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,510
So groupmod might be the better option.

30
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:31,067
Groupmod -U anna sales, for instance,

31
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,160
and that seems to be successful.

32
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,230
So let's use id on Anna again

33
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,030
and we can see the user Anna

34
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,220
is a member of the group sales.

35
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,720
If you want to see all users

36
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,040
that are a member of this group,

37
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,980
lid is what you can use.

38
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:54,980
So lid -g sales will print
a list of all the users

39
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,120
who are currently a member.

40
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,310
This is particularly interesting to do

41
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,701
on groups that are important,
like wheel, for instance.

42
00:02:03,701 --> 00:02:05,520
Lid -g wheel.

43
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,670
Yeah, I'm happy to see that
only you as a student currently

44
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,250
is a member of the group wheel.

45
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,620
And I guess this is about
all you need to know

46
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,050
about creating and managing groups.

47
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,133
So let's continue.
