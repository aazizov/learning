1
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,340
- When defining users,

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,130
there are different properties
that need to be set.

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,840
And I wanna talk about them.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,890
You set these properties in
/etc/passwd, here they are.

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,180
Start with the name.

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,000
The name is the name of the user account.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,480
It's a human understandable
name, so it's for people.

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,980
Then there is the password.

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,400
The password is the secret that
is used for authentication.

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,690
It may be disabled, but for
people uses normally, it is not.

11
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:34,800
For system users.

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,470
However, they should
never have a password.

13
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,030
They should be disabled.

14
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,630
Shouldn't be possible to
log in as a system user.

15
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:47,190
Next is a UID, which is a
unique identifier for user.

16
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,840
The GID is another ID
for the primary group.

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,310
When you create a user,

18
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,920
every user is a member
of exactly one group,

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,440
which is called the primary group.

20
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,600
Then there is a so-called GECOS field,

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,960
which contains additional
non-mandatory information

22
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,550
about the user.

23
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,770
We have home directories
for the environment

24
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,900
where users can create personal files.

25
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,900
And finally, there is a
Shell, which is a program

26
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,590
that will be started after
successful authentication.

27
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,760
For ordinary users,

28
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,250
the Shell is normally set to bin bash.

29
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,870
For system users,

30
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,340
it should be set to bin false,

31
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,250
or anything that disallows
the user to log in.

32
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,250
Let me show you the contents
of this /etc/passwd file.

33
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,607
Okay. So, if I use cat on /etc/passwd,

34
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,453
we can see the contents
of this passwd file.

35
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,210
Just picking out two random lines.

36
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,310
We have a line FTP.

37
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,000
This is a user that can be
created by the FTP server.

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,230
And we can see that this
FTP user has a directory,

39
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,240
a home directory via FTP.

40
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,250
Which happens to be the environment,

41
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,010
where this user can work with,

42
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,050
can create files and stuff like that.

43
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,330
Very important, as this is a system user

44
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:07,350
the Shell is set to slash
sbin slash no login.

45
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,720
So, no matter what this user is not going

46
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,658
to be able to log in ever.

47
00:02:12,658 --> 00:02:15,930
Here, we have the first person user,

48
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,350
use a student that's
our administrative user.

49
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,950
We can see that people users
normally start their user IDs

50
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,110
at number 1000.

51
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,440
And the home directory
is set to sub directory

52
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,273
in slash home.

53
00:02:29,273 --> 00:02:31,230
And the Shell is set to bin bash.

54
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,700
So, that is what we need

55
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,460
for ordinary people to be logging in.

56
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,000
On some of cases, you can
also see users that have,

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,870
that do have a Shell, but which
is a very specific program.

58
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,820
Like here, the halt user,

59
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,710
which is used for halting your system,

60
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,540
a slash sbin slash halt.

61
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,520
Which allows you to stop your system,

62
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,750
or the sync user,

63
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,430
as the sync binary,

64
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,800
which allows this user
to synchronize Shells

65
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,263
to whatever you want
them to synchronize with.

66
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,460
So, that's all about the user properties.

67
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,950
As we can find them in /etc/passwd,

68
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,080
there are more properties
in /etc/skeleton.

69
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,200
We'll talk about them later.

70
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,683
Let's first go and create some users.
