1
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,830
- An important property of
the user is group membership.

2
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,890
Each user must be a member
of at least one group.

3
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,150
That's a primary group,

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,823
and the primary group is
created automatically.

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,030
That happens when you create a user.

6
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,110
At that moment,

7
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,180
a primary group with the
same name of the user

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,920
is created as well.

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,610
Primary group membership is
managed through /etc/passwd.

10
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,500
The user of primary group is so important

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,220
because it becomes group-owner
if a user creates a file.

12
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,560
Additional groups can be defined as well.

13
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,690
That's a secondary group membership,

14
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,310
and the secondary group membership

15
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,650
is managed through /etc/groups.

16
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,350
Secondary group membership
is normal, convenient.

17
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,950
If a user needs additional
access to some functionality,

18
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,870
think of the group wheel, for instance,

19
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,130
that you would use to make sure

20
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,953
that the user can use des using sudo.

21
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,300
A user can temporarily set
primary group membership

22
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,190
using newgrp.

23
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,600
That might be convenient

24
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,240
if you want to take some functionality

25
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,100
after your account has been changed

26
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,840
without logging in again,

27
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,840
because if properties
of a user are changed,

28
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,150
the user needs to log in again

29
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,890
to make these properties effective.

30
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,720
That's not always convenient.

31
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,700
You are currently logged in as a user,

32
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,500
and the administrator grants you access

33
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,720
to the group wheel, for instance,

34
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,733
just type newgrp wheel.

35
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,940
The id command is convenient because

36
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,000
it will show you which
group a user is a member of.

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,960
In the next video,

38
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,293
I'll demonstrate how to manage
groups and group membership.
