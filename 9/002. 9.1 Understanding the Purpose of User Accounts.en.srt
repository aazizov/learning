00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,730
- All right, before we are starting

2
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,100
this important lesson about users,

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,710
it makes sense to think a little bit

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,830
about what exactly is the
user, why do we need them?

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,750
What is the purpose?

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,840
So the philosophy of the user on Linux.

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,630
A user on Linux is a security principle

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,850
and user accounts are
used to provide people

9
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,060
or processes access to system resources.

10
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,940
That's the most important
thing that you should remember.

11
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,150
It's for people, but also for processes.

12
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,430
Processes are using system accounts

13
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,923
and people are using
regular user accounts.

14
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,810
And for both of them,
you need a user account.

15
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:50,340
And regardless of whether it's
for processes or for people,

16
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,660
you process the same.

17
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,093
In the next couple of
videos, you'll learn how.
