1
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,733
- All right.

2
00:00:07,733 --> 00:00:09,870
An important task as
a system administrator

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,540
is that you need to be
able to limit user access.

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,910
That will make your system more secure.

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,170
How do we do that?

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,720
Well, there's a couple of options.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,650
You can lock user accounts, temporarily.

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,710
Use usermod-L to lock a user

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,610
or usermod-U to unlock a user.

10
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,553
You can also set user accounts to expire.

11
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,600
Use usermod-E to do so.

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,358
And don't forget about the sbin/nologin.

13
00:00:41,358 --> 00:00:43,530
sbin/nologin as a shell
is what you wanna do

14
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,920
for users that are not
intended to log in at all.

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,250
I already mentioned that this
is a setting that should apply

16
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,770
to all of these system users.

17
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,963
Now let me show you
how to lock an account.

18
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,330
Okay, so I am going to start

19
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:04,600
using usermod-L on Bill

20
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,490
which is doing a lot, though
it's not telling me anything.

21
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,100
In order to figure out
if it was successful,

22
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,580
passwd-S on Bill is convenient.

23
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,413
And what do we see?

24
00:01:15,413 --> 00:01:18,120
We see password for user Bill is locked.

25
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,510
That's a result of the usermod-L.

26
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,793
Now usermod-U.

27
00:01:24,701 --> 00:01:25,534
Well, there we go.

28
00:01:25,534 --> 00:01:26,367
Password is set.

29
00:01:26,367 --> 00:01:28,140
So the password is no longer locked.

30
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,240
Now let's get back to the locked password.

31
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,460
So now user Bill is locked again.

32
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,640
And, if we grab user Bill on ATC shadow,

33
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,360
which is a file where
encrypted passwords are stored

34
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,000
we can see the encrypted password.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,100
It's the long string right here.

36
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,600
And if this encrypted password

37
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,310
starts with an exclamation mark,

38
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,410
exclamation mark means

39
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,540
that it's currently locked,.

40
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,653
Cannot be used.

41
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,800
So you could even do that yourself.

42
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,460
If you have a user, you
temporarily want to lock that user,

43
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,000
put an exclamation mark in
front of the password string.

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,300
Compare that to user Lisa who
has double exclamation mark,

45
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,213
that's what you get if a
password has never been set.

46
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:14,793
Now we have used usermod
to lock this user account.

47
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,000
And usermod is one way of doing it.

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,933
You can also use passwd
for similar functionality.
