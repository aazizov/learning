00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,600
- This video is about
creating and managing users,

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,610
which in fact is super easy.

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,950
There is just four
commands that are involved.

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,080
Useradd, which allows you to create.

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,450
Usermod, which allows you to modify.

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,630
Userdel, which allows you
to delete user accounts.

7
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,720
And once you have created
or modified or deleted,

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,220
you can set passwords.

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,620
Well, probably not on deleted users,

10
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,660
but for the other users you can.

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,480
PassWD is how to do it.

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,193
Let's check out these commands.

13
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,270
So, in order to work with these users,

14
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,920
and probably from this moment on,

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,239
I will be in our root shell sudo minus I.

16
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,710
That's also something
that I would advise to do

17
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,160
on your RHCSA exam,
just open a root shell,

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,530
because it's about system administration,

19
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:53,670
and you need to be root

20
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,803
in order to do system administration.

21
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,390
So, if you use commands like this,

22
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,390
might be smart to use a little command

23
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,720
Minus minus help and
pipe the output to less.

24
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,750
And here we can see all the
different options that exist

25
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,630
for creating this user account.

26
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,548
So let me use useradd to
create user Lori, for instance.

27
00:01:17,548 --> 00:01:20,520
Minus U is an option
that you can use to set

28
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,830
the user id yourself, if you want.

29
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,720
So minus U, 2000.

30
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,070
Normally people users have
a user ID higher than 1000,

31
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,510
so anything goes.

32
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:33,570
And minus S if you want to set the shell.

33
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:37,830
So, if this user is supposed
to be never logging in

34
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:42,830
you set it to slash sbin
slash nologin, for instance.

35
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:48,210
I mean, all of these are
parameters that you can set

36
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,490
and to figure out if that works,

37
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,240
we'll grab Lori on ETC PassWD.

38
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,620
And there, we can see that the user

39
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,140
has been created successfully.

40
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,150
Is it useful? I'm not sure.

41
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:05,100
So, let's delete user
Lori again: userdel lori

42
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,043
Oh, wait, userdel, minus minus help.

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,930
Why is that?

44
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:13,680
Well, because I want to
check out some options,

45
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,660
in particular, these
options: minus RF Lori.

46
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,810
If you don't do this,
then some information

47
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,510
about the user might stick around,

48
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,605
and if you use userdel minus
RF, you remove the user,

49
00:02:28,605 --> 00:02:33,390
you force the user off, and
everything is clean afterwards.

50
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,890
And that's all for now you need to know

51
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,363
about creating users.
