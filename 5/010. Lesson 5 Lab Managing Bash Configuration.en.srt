1
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:07,523
- All right.

2
00:00:07,523 --> 00:00:09,120
Once again, we are at
the end of the lesson.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,740
Let's do a lab.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,230
In this lab, to start
with, set a variable color

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,180
to the value red and
ensure that the setting

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,780
is available every time your
current user account logs in.

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,800
Also, create an alias that
runs the command ls-ltr

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,170
while executing the dir command.

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,020
And ensure that the Bash
History file can grow

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,110
to a maximum size of 2,500 entries.

11
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:31,943
That's all.

12
00:00:31,943 --> 00:00:32,776
Enjoy.
