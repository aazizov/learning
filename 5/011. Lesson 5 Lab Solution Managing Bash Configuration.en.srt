00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:08,640
- Okay, so in this lab,

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,190
we really need to tweak
the Bash environment.

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,120
The big question is,

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,190
do I really want to do that for everybody?

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,540
I don't think so.

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,743
So let me have a look at .bash_profile,

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,070
we didn't have a look at that one yet.

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,190
I just wanted to show you,
get the alias and functions,

9
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,640
and user specific environment,
and startup programs.

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,780
That looks good.

11
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,470
So I am going to use export.

12
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,430
Export color is red to start with.

13
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,247
Then we need to create an alias, so alias,

14
00:00:42,247 --> 00:00:44,160
(computer keyboard clacking)

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,133
alias dir=,

16
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,083
between single quotes,
very important, 'ls - ltr'.

17
00:00:52,545 --> 00:00:55,500
"ls - ltr" is a nice way

18
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,860
of sorting files by modification time.

19
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,470
And next ensure that the Bash history file

20
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:05,070
can grow to a maximum
size of 2,500 entries.

21
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:05,903
What do you think?

22
00:01:05,903 --> 00:01:09,060
Is that something that we
can do for individual users?

23
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,039
Let's just try it.

24
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:12,447
Export HIST,

25
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:16,263
(computer keyboard clacking)

26
00:01:16,263 --> 00:01:19,246
HIST FILE SIZE is 2,500.

27
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,992
(computer keyboard clacking)

28
00:01:21,992 --> 00:01:22,825
There we go.

29
00:01:22,825 --> 00:01:26,340
Now we need to make sure
that this new .bash_profile

30
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,050
is going to be effective.

31
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:30,960
How do we do that? Maybe by sourcing it.

32
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,990
I'm using source .bash_profile.

33
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,450
That's something that I
haven't explained yet,

34
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:37,800
so let me explain.

35
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,210
If you use source,

36
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,810
you really include the
contents of a shell script,

37
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,580
a shell environment file.

38
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,740
So if that was successful

39
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,700
then I should be able to use
dir, and well, that is working.

40
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,210
And how about echo HIST FILE SIZE?

41
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,480
Yeah, we have HIST file size set to 2,500.

42
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,480
Now last, the variable $color,

43
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,690
and as you can see, color is set to red.

44
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,870
Now with this, we haven't
only completed the lab,

45
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,870
we have also seen something
else that's very interesting.

46
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,820
We have HIST FILE SIZE.

47
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,490
HIST FILE SIZE is a
generic system variable.

48
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,650
Even the generic system variables

49
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,200
can be overwritten at
a user specific level,

50
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,800
which is what we have just done.
