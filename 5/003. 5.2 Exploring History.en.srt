1
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,280
- In this video, I will tell you about

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,530
another great of the feature bash shell.

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:11,363
History.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,290
So, bash registers recently used commands

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,693
and you can type history for an overview.

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,110
Now, the commands that
are stored in history

7
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,460
are kept in a file,

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,350
which is in the home directory till this

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,120
the home directory and
the name of the file

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,160
is .bash_history.

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,280
And that makes them
available beyond sessions.

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,010
So once you log out,
you restart your server,

13
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,650
you can still access
your previous history.

14
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,710
The size of the history
is set by two variables,

15
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,630
HISTSIZE and HISTFILESIZE.

16
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,970
By default they are set to 1000

17
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,710
and that means that if you are not doing

18
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,390
very much on the Linux shell

19
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,573
you might even find commands
that you've used a year ago.

20
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,780
Now history is convenient,

21
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,010
but what it's all about is to
repeat commands from history.

22
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,790
There are different ways to
repeat commands from history.

23
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,320
You can use the up arrow

24
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,490
to easily repeat commands
by scrolling backwards.

25
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,260
You can also use Control R

26
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,880
which performs a reverse search

27
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,250
based on the pattern that you've entered.

28
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,910
Or !nn where NN is the number.

29
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,080
This will repeat a command

30
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,630
from history based on its number.

31
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,570
And !a repeats the last command

32
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,340
that starts with the letter A.

33
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,233
Before, moving on, let me show you.

34
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,630
So here we have the history command

35
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,873
and as you can see, I have
used 63 commands already.

36
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,400
Now I can use my arrow key and scroll up

37
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,760
and repeat commands.

38
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,900
I can also use exclamation
mark command number.

39
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,920
And in fact, I like this
exclamation mark command number

40
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,600
because that allows me to repeat

41
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,300
a command very specifically.

42
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,770
Alternatively, you can use
control R, the reverse I search.

43
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,620
So if I'm searching on user,

44
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,550
now you can see that on my prompt

45
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,510
I automatically get the last
command that had user in it.

46
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,680
So I'm pressing Enter on
it and then I repeat it.

47
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,500
Now, repeating commands
from history is nice

48
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,780
but the fact that everything
is stored in history

49
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,760
is not always that convenient.

50
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,760
Let's talk a little bit more about that.

51
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,470
So every now and then you
need to manage history

52
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,800
and there are a couple
of commands involved.

53
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,680
History -w synchronizes current history

54
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,680
from memory to the history file.

55
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,310
Normally your history is
synchronized if you log out

56
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,070
or if you exit your shell properly.

57
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,300
But if you wanna make sure

58
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,640
that you keep important modifications

59
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,430
it doesn't hurt using history -w

60
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,490
so that if one minute
later your server crashes

61
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,890
you still have your history.

62
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,610
History -c clears your
current history, all of it.

63
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,950
And if you really want
to remove everything

64
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:09,210
then you should not forget
to also use history -w

65
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:13,410
to commit this to the history file.

66
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:14,880
Much more convenient

67
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,800
and this is something
that you are probably

68
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,720
going to use a lot is history
-d followed by a line number.

69
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,170
This will remove the specific
line from current history.

70
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,103
Let me show you.

71
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,530
So here we have the history command

72
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:35,490
and I think command number
56 did not make sense.

73
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:39,150
So I'm using !56.

74
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:43,170
Well, no, I don't want
to keep that command

75
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:47,370
so I'm using history -d on 56.

76
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,340
And now if I'm using history again,

77
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,540
now, what do we see?

78
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:56,520
We see that the previous LS
whatever has been removed.

79
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,140
And hey, just a detail, if
it's really that important,

80
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,560
we should also repeat 66
which has the same command.

81
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,810
Again, be careful to remove whatever

82
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:09,280
you want to remove using history -d

83
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:13,380
but history -d definitely is convenient

84
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:17,790
especially if you have typed
your password by accident

85
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,130
then it's stored in history as well.

86
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,420
Now there's one little thing,

87
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,780
if I open a second tab in my terminal

88
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:29,780
and I type history in this
second tab, then what do we see?

89
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,070
And as you can see, we don't have

90
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,100
the 60 something commands
from my other terminal,

91
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,890
this is only a limited number of commands.

92
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:41,040
Now, if I type echo hello world

93
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,630
and then I get back to my first
terminal and I use history,

94
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,880
do I see echo hello world?

95
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,470
Well, the answer is no

96
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,510
because normally history is kept

97
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:54,183
local to your terminal session.

98
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,320
There are two ways to write your history,

99
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,190
history -w or if you
just close your terminal

100
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,590
the decent way by typing exit,

101
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,930
then your history is merged as well.

102
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:10,680
Notice that right now I see
69 commands in my history.

103
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,500
And right now, oh, it's still 69 commands

104
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,120
that did not change anything.

105
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,373
Well I'm going to exit this terminal.

106
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,203
And now I'm going to
enter my terminal again.

107
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,050
And once more, history,
and what do we see?

108
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,610
78 commands.

109
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,760
That's because the two
histories have now been merged,

110
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,000
they've been written to the history file.

111
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,180
This is something that you
should definitely remember

112
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,600
if you have multiple
terminals that you work from

113
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,930
your history might be saved out of order.

114
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,430
And this is how you can work

115
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,773
even if your history
is saved out of order.
