00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,340
In this lesson, you'll
learn about the Bash shell,

00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,830
the command interpreter on Linux.

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,470
This lesson is about different
features that it offers

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,200
to make working on the
command line easier.

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,990
You'll learn how to work
with redirection and piping

7
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,490
as well as history.

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,370
Next, I'll show you some
convenient keyboard shortcuts

9
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,920
that will make working
with the shell easier.

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,780
Then you'll learn about shell expansion,

11
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,350
special characters, variables,
and the alias command.

12
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,940
And in the end, I will show you

13
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,470
how to tune the best environment

14
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,723
using the different configuration files.

15
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,610

00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,013
