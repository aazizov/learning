00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:09,630
- In this video, we'll
be talking about alias.

2
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,240
Alias is a solution that best providing

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,750
which allows you to define
your own custom commands.

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,160
That can be useful.

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,360
Some commands defined

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,390
as an alias are provided
as a system default

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,483
and to get an overview,
you can just type alias.

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,670
Also, you can define them
yourselves like alias key is value

9
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,770
which will define your own alias.

10
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,170
It's a little bit like
defining a variable just

11
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,943
with the word alias in front of it.

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:41,870
For instance, use alias
del='rm -rf /' don't forget

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,240
the single quotes here to avoid
any interpretation problems.

14
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,350
If at one point in time

15
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,250
you don't want to use your
aliases anymore, use unalias.

16
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,900
Custom aliases that are provided

17
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,820
by the operating system are stored

18
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,040
in the Bash startup files.

19
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,173
Let's go have a look at some examples.

20
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:05,670
If I type alias

21
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,580
then I get a list of all
the aliases that exist.

22
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,382
So zgrep, do I really want to use zgrep?

23
00:01:12,382 --> 00:01:17,250
ps aux | zgrep ssh.

24
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,260
Well, as you can see, it works.

25
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,573
If I don't like it, unalias zgrep.

26
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,270
That's one alias that
I'm never using myself.

27
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:31,530
Probably more comfortable
is to define your own alias.

28
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,740
So alias

29
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:39,970
del=rm '-rf /tmp'.

30
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,150
Let's not do it on slash

31
00:01:43,047 --> 00:01:44,490
because that will be a
very dangerous command

32
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,590
if you run it the wrong way.

33
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,390
Now, if I type alias

34
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,710
then I should be able to see
my del command right here.

35
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,410
And if I now am going
to run my del command,

36
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,300
Hmm, maybe not a very good idea.

37
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,860
So unalias del, and
let's do something else

38
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,117
like alias del='hello world'.

39
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,810
Hello world, that's not a command,

40
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,100
must be a command.

41
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,140
So now I can use del to show you

42
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,493
that at least it's working.
