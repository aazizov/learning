00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,810
- In this video, we'll talk
about special characters

2
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,520
that need to be escaped.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,323
Now, what is escaping all about?

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,380
Well, we have seen it in expansion,

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,110
special characters are
interpreted by the shell

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,080
to attribute a special
meaning to the variables.

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,293
And in escaping, this special
meaning is taken away.

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,860
There are three different
ways to use escaping.

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,450
Double quotes to start with,

10
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,490
they suppress globbing and shell expansion

11
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,400
but do allow command and
variable substitution,

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,140
so they're quite weak.

13
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,090
Single quotes take away
the special meaning

14
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,650
of any characters.

15
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,290
And backslash protects the
following character only

16
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,670
from expansion.

17
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,513
Let me show you.

18
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:54,380
Okay, let me show you
first, ls -l myfile output,

19
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,920
which is using the ls command
with two different arguments.

20
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,343
Now, what if I put these
arguments between double quotes?

21
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,700
Then we can get an error message,

22
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,260
no such file or directory,

23
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,270
because the double quotes
take away the meaning

24
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,933
of the spaces, and that is what they do.

25
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,130
Now, how about echo $PATH?

26
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,490
Well, here we can see $PATH is interpreted

27
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,460
and if I don't want
$PATH to be interpreted

28
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,500
I can put it between single quotes.

29
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,840
Single quotes work here,
double quotes don't,

30
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,320
because double quotes don't
take away the meaning of a $.

31
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,190
But as in this case,
it's only one character

32
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,440
that I want to take away the meaning for.

33
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,040
I might also use a
backslash for the escaping.

34
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,863
There we go, that's all you
need to know about escaping.
