1
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,030
- The BASH shell is providing a number

2
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,070
of very useful keyboard shortcuts,

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,350
they really make your work easier.

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:14,253
Let's have a look.

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,190
To start with there's Control + C

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,890
which quits the current
interactive process.

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,570
If you're getting stuck in some command

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,900
and it doesn't want to
move, try Control + C.

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,730
There's also Control + D,

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,770
Control + D sends an end-of-file character

11
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,050
to the current interactive process.

12
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,670
It might not always be clear

13
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,770
when to use Control + C, Control + D.

14
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,400
My suggestion is just try,
one of them will work.

15
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,710
Control + A, you've seen
me doing it a couple

16
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:41,550
of times already.

17
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,080
It moves your cursor to the start

18
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,240
of the current line and that allows you

19
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,000
to add commands to the current line.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,980
Or Control + E which moves the cursor

21
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,530
to the end of the current line.

22
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,360
We have talked about Control + R

23
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,493
which is the reverse search in history.

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,580
We have not yet talked about Control + L

25
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,170
which clears your screen

26
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,963
so that you don't see any
previous commands anymore.

27
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,610
Control + U is also convenient,
it removes the current line.

28
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,520
And then there are a couple
of keyboard shortcuts

29
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,710
that allows you to move between words.

30
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,340
Like Alt B, which moves the
cursor one word backward.

31
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,580
The last keyboard shortcut
I wanna talk about is Alt F,

32
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,340
which moves the cursor
one, one word forward

33
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,530
can be quite convenient as well.

34
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,080
Let me show you how this works.

35
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,610
So here we have my screen
with lots of commands.

36
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,190
I'm using Control + L to wipe it.

37
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:38,130
And now I am using Echo.

38
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,440
Hello world.

39
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,030
Hello world.

40
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,150
How are you today?

41
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,950
I am fine.

42
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,780
And how are you?

43
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,480
I'm just typing some, some stuff here

44
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,890
and I'm repeating my command

45
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,260
to show you Alt + B for backwards.

46
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,260
That will be the option key
if you're on Mac keyboard,

47
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,600
or Alt + F for forwards,

48
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,010
but I don't wanna go forwards.

49
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,660
I want to go all the way back.

50
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,170
So Control + A for all
the way to the beginning.

51
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,460
So this is all you need to know

52
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,250
about all these convenient
keyboard shortcuts.

53
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,273
Let's continue.
