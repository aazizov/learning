00:00:06,641 --> 00:00:09,723
- In this video, we are
going to explore variables.

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,010
The mission of a variable is
to separate site specific data

3
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,930
from generic code

4
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:18,300
and the shell comes with
standard system variables

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,920
in the environment

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,820
to get an overview

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,340
of these system variables you can type env

8
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,780
for environment.

9
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,300
Users can define variables
themselves as well.

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,540
Using export key is value.

11
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,760
Defining your own
variables is mainly useful

12
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,140
in scripting

13
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,610
to make variables persistent,

14
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,800
they should be stored in
the Bash startup files.

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,350
I'll tell you more about those later.

16
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,123
Let's go check out some variables.

17
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,887
So let's start with the command env

18
00:00:46,887 --> 00:00:48,630
env for environment.

19
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,160
And in the environment we say

20
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,900
we can see different settings,

21
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,090
like no terminal session

22
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,422
and user,

23
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:56,670
the current user,

24
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,500
and so many more

25
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,620
which all relates to the
current state of the system.

26
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,240
This is where the operating system is

27
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,953
getting its own values from.

28
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,000
And we have seen already
a couple of them like HIST

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,980
if I use echo dollar HIST

30
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,240
and then I hit the tab key,

31
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,230
then what do we see?

32
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:17,190
I see all the variables that
cause that start with HIST

33
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,540
like HIST size

34
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,200
1000 for the history
size or echo dollar path

35
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,430
which is the current path

36
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,310
that the operating system is using.

37
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,130
I can also define my own variables

38
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,480
by using

39
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,523
key equals value.

40
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,630
And next I can use echo dollar

41
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,130
followed by the name of the key

42
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,143
to request the current value.

43
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,090
But the thing is that this
variable is a local variable.

44
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,330
If I would start another
shell like a sub shell

45
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,530
as well I've done right now

46
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,350
and I use echo dollar color again,

47
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,090
I don't see it anymore.

48
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,820
And that's why if you
want to set variables,

49
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,990
well first you need to do it

50
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,210
through some of the Bash startup files

51
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:03,390
because that makes sure they
are available everywhere.

52
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,160
But even if you want to set them

53
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,390
on the command line,

54
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,310
at least use export.

55
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,350
So if I use exports,

56
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:13,590
color equals green for instance

57
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,720
and then I go to a sub shell

58
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,910
and I use echo dollar color again,

59
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,760
at least I can see this variable still,

60
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,250
but that works for sub shells,

61
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,970
not in new shells that you are opening

62
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:30,750
because if right now I'm
using echo dollar color

63
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,430
then I'm getting nothing.

64
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,300
As I said,

65
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,150
if you really want these
variables to be persistent

66
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,793
you should set them in
the Bash startup files.
