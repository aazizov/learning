00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:07,770
- Okay, before we continue,

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,321
I want to talk a little bit
about using RHEL in Cloud.

3
00:00:11,321 --> 00:00:14,040
The most important thing
that you should notice

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,163
is that using RHEL in Cloud is different.

5
00:00:18,013 --> 00:00:22,320
To start with, in Cloud, RHEL
is deployed, not installed.

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,810
And also, a very important difference

7
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,980
is that the Cloud provides
the boot procedure, not Linux.

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,780
And different procedures are used

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,880
by different Cloud providers.

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,150
And because of all these
differences, in this class,

11
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,600
you should not be using a Cloud instance.

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,760
If you want to become an RHCSA,

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,580
you need to be able to access
your booting RHEL system

14
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,940
if anything goes wrong in the
boot, in the boot procedure.

15
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,126
So, you need access to a grip boot prompt,

16
00:00:50,126 --> 00:00:54,000
and in most cases, in
Cloud, that is not the case.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,600
So, really, using a RHEL instance in Cloud

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,173
is not a good idea to
get you ready for RHCSA.
