1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,070
- All right.

2
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,520
We have just seen how to
do a basic installation.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,520
In many cases, you don't
wanna do a basic installation,

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,220
but you might want to
do custom partitioning.

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,380
Let's talk about the need
for custom partitioning

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,540
before I'm going to show you.

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,070
So Linux service typically,

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,593
multiple storage volumes are used.

9
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,470
You will learn that
different options exist

10
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,090
for these storage volumes.

11
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,400
Like partitions, which
are the base solution

12
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,893
for offering multiple
separate storage areas.

13
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,820
Another option is to use logical volumes,

14
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,460
which can be used as
alternatives to partitions.

15
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,223
And you will learn later
about them in lesson 19.

16
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,490
Now, whatever you are
doing, in most cases,

17
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,160
a small partition containing
all that is required

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,250
for booting is created,
and a root partition,

19
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,250
which contains the operating
system should be there.

20
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,130
And other file types
that are often organized

21
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,650
on dedicated partitions are log files,

22
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:05,070
and user home directories,
and server document roots,

23
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:09,480
and the location for
container images, and more.

24
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,280
And the reason, well, you just want them

25
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,790
to be strictly separated from
your core operating system.

26
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,860
So, custom partitioning is exactly

27
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,810
what we are going to do in the next demo.

28
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:19,683
Let me show you.

29
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,110
All right, so if you want to
install a custom partitioning,

30
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:25,980
this is where you go.

31
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,110
You select automatic partitioning,

32
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,810
and then you need to select custom.

33
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,610
It's a little bit counterintuitive,

34
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,090
but you select custom,
and then you click done.

35
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,037
And that'll bring you to the
RHEL installation interface.

36
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,200
So it's telling you,

37
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,020
new mount points will use
following partition scheme.

38
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,980
I don't want to use LVM, I want
to use standard partitions.

39
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:53,610
And then you can create all of
these partitions one by one.

40
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,860
So I'm clicking plus.

41
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,720
To start with, I want to
create a partition for /boot.

42
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,090
Notice that they can
conveniently be selected

43
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,950
from the dropdown list.

44
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,173
And I'm giving it the size of 500M.

45
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,370
500M, that is good enough.

46
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,083
The installer will understand.

47
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,710
Let's not worry about
all the other options

48
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,840
that we see right here like file system.

49
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,930
It is just using XFS, which
is a default file system.

50
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,733
And default file system is okay.

51
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,400
Next, I would like to have
a root partition, the slash.

52
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,450
And I give it a size of 12 gigabytes.

53
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,960
And then, many times on your server,

54
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,210
you also want a swap partition.

55
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,360
So let's use one G of swap.

56
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,010
And finally, let's add another partition,

57
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:52,010
which is using three gigabytes
for home, for instance.

58
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,250
So you click at mount
points, then you click, done.

59
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:01,250
And once you have clicked,
done, you will get an overview.

60
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,860
So the only thing remaining
is to accept changes,

61
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,650
and that will bring you back
to the main installation window

62
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:10,140
from which you can
continue the installation

63
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,403
as we have seen before.
