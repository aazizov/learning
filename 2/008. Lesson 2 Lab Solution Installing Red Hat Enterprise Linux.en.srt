1
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,180
- All right, so to start with,

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,600
you need to select, Install
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.0.

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,180
If you don't, doesn't really change a lot

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,060
but you will need to
wait a little bit longer

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,470
while the integrity of the
installation media is verified.

6
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,320
So, you need to select
the installation language,

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,820
set to English.

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,070
And then one of the most important option

9
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,290
is the Installation Destination.

10
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:36,120
We are not going to use
the automatic installation,

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,200
we need custom.

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,400
So you select Custom.

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,400
Then you click Done.

14
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,910
Next, you select Standard
Partitioning and you click +.

15
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,990
So, the Mount Point that
must be /boot to start with.

16
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:53,190
And I know that wasn't
even asked for in the lab,

17
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,290
so we don't do /boot.

18
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,113
We just do a 10 gigabyte root partition.

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,440
So, you click at Mount Point

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,780
and then you repeat the procedure

21
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,710
by creating a one gigabyte swap partition.

22
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,790
You will learn all about why
this might be useful later

23
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,680
in this course, for this
moment you just need to do it.

24
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,680
So, I'm already done in the partitioning

25
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,810
which means I can click Done.

26
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,480
And have a look at the
overview of the changes

27
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,143
and if that looks okay,
click Accept Changes.

28
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,930
Next, we need to make sure that

29
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,000
server with GUI is installed.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,560
That automatically happens.

31
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,960
So, no changes needed here.

32
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,160
You need to make sure

33
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,720
that your server is
connected to a network.

34
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,820
As you can see my network card

35
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,310
which is named ens160 is connected

36
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,050
and it already has an IP address.

37
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,400
So that's good.

38
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,590
Also, no changes needed here

39
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,510
and we need to set a
password for the root user.

40
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,750
So, going once, going twice

41
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,600
and I'm clicking Done and Done again

42
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,440
because the password is too
simple, that's on purpose.

43
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,010
And then we need to wait until
the installation is done.

44
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:12,150
After the installation

45
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,630
you can create a user account to be used

46
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,953
throughout this course.

47
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,060
Okay, at this point

48
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,430
the installer is prompting
to reboot the system.

49
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,233
So, let's reboot the system.

50
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,140
Okay, so here we can see the last bit,

51
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,120
that's the get started,

52
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,060
where you click yes and Next
and Next to accept many things

53
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,740
but you still need to create your account.

54
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,290
So, let's see About You part,

55
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,780
where you provide your username,

56
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,210
the password that you want to use.

57
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,100
And after creating that user account

58
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,400
you can start using Red
Hat Enterprise Linux.

59
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,680
So, in the next lesson, you will learn

60
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,773
all about what you can do on
this Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
