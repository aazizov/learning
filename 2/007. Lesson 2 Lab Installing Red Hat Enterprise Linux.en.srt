1
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:09,180
- So at this point, you
know how to install RHEL.

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,943
Well, I would say let's
practice that in a lab.

3
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,120
In this lab, please install a RHEL server

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,220
that meets a couple of requirements.

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,710
A graphical user interface is installed.

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,840
You'll have a 10 gigabyte root partition,

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,733
and one gigabyte swap partition.

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,000
You need to make sure that
at least four gigabyte

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,343
of disc space remains as unused.

10
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,920
Set the root password to password,

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,380
and create a user student with a password,

12
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,730
also set to password,

13
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,500
and configure the network interface

14
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,960
to contact DHCP server.

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,793
Good luck.
