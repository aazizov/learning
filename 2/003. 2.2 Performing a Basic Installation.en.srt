1
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,520
- [Instructor] So once you
have booted your machine

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,210
from the Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 9 installation media,

3
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,680
this is what you get.

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,260
By default, it wants you
test the installation media

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,610
before you can install.

6
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:22,140
I would suggest not to do that.

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,980
Just select, "Install Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 9."

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,280
Now, you will see the blinking
cursor for a few seconds

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,013
and then it starts loading
the installation system.

10
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,300
And here we have access to
the graphical installation.

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,340
Okay, so to start with,

12
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,040
we need to select a language, English.

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,080
English, United States,
is the only language

14
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,013
that makes sense.

15
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,700
For your service, it's nice
to know that you can install

16
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,520
in a different language, but for the exam,

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,800
that's really not something to do.

18
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,740
And here we can see the
Installation Summary screen.

19
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,230
Now, the nice thing about the
Installation Summary screen

20
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,710
is that you only have to provide choices

21
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,813
for the things that are different.

22
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,590
And if you really want to
go for the minimal options,

23
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,870
you only have to follow the links in red.

24
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:16,113
So, we need to select
Installation Destination.

25
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,010
By default, it wants to
do automatic partitioning

26
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,500
and there's an exclamation mark here.

27
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,880
That is because the installer

28
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,030
is going to override your entire disk.

29
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,800
You can see the disk that it has found,

30
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,380
a 20 gigabyte disk in VMware,

31
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,390
which is known as sda.

32
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,760
And the storage configuration
is set to automatic,

33
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,960
and that's perfect.

34
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,210
I just have to click "Done" here

35
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,983
to tell the software
installer that we are good

36
00:01:40,983 --> 00:01:45,093
and that it's okay to
override the entire disk.

37
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,610
The next required option is
related to the user settings.

38
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,430
This is about the root password.

39
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,830
The root is your system administrator user

40
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,960
and this user needs a password.

41
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,090
So, let me enter a password

42
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,823
and I need to enter the
same password twice.

43
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,030
Notice that the installer has detected

44
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,860
that I have a weak password.

45
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,420
I wanna have a weak password,

46
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,910
I don't care about it
for this demo system.

47
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,950
And that is why in the
lower part it's telling me

48
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,660
that I need to click "Done" twice

49
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,463
to accept the weak password.

50
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,380
Also, there is an option

51
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,270
if I want to do, "Lock the root accounts,"

52
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,190
that you can only log in
using an administrative user

53
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,360
and an option that you need to separately

54
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,620
specify to allow a root
SSH login with password.

55
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,470
By default, the root user
cannot use Secure Shell

56
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,883
to connect to your server.

57
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,660
I am going to click
done twice because this

58
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,120
is exactly matching what I need.

59
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,690
And then I will have a quick
look at three other options.

60
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,120
There are many more options available,

61
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,300
but only a few more that matter.

62
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,773
To start with the networking,

63
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,580
we can see that my wired
network connection is connected

64
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,860
and that's all that I want to verify.

65
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,640
I obtained an IP address
from the DHCP server.

66
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,030
My server is connected,
so I'm clicking "Done."

67
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,430
You don't even have to set a host name,

68
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,590
we'll take care of that later.

69
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,353
The next option is the Software Selection,

70
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,140
where it is going to select server

71
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,020
with graphical user interface.

72
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,810
I think that's the option
you wanna use as well

73
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,840
in order to get familiar with
Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

74
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,530
But very commonly used
are the Server option

75
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,390
and the Minimal installation,

76
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,650
which don't offer you access

77
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,990
to any graphical user interface.

78
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,810
But here, we are just going
to keep it for while it is.

79
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,140
And about the choice
for additional software,

80
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,240
that's not something
you have to worry about.

81
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,920
We can do that later.

82
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,450
So let me click "Done."

83
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,290
And last but not least, the time zone.

84
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,570
America, Chicago time zone.

85
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:54,300
Well, depends on where you are.

86
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,010
It is nice to set your server

87
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:59,130
to a time that matches
your local time zone.

88
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,010
So let me do that and then click "Done."

89
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:05,190
And next, we can click
"Begin Installation,"

90
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,050
which is starting the installation.

91
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:11,343
And this is the part that
takes at least five minutes.

92
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,310
Alright, the installation is now done.

93
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,100
So let's click "Reboot System," to reboot.

94
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,690
One of the first things that you will see

95
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,570
after rebooting is the GRUB boot loader.

96
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,710
In this GRUB boot loader,

97
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:25,440
you can see your current kernel version

98
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,360
and there's also a rescue system.

99
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,400
We're not going to use a rescue system,

100
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,900
so I'm just going to press
enter on the default selection.

101
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,500
This GRUB boot loader is going
to be very important later on

102
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,610
because you can use it to
pass specific boot options,

103
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,740
which can be useful if
anything doesn't work out

104
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,840
the way you expect it to be.

105
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,633
So, here we can see the set of wizards.

106
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,130
You need to go through it and
indicate what you wanna do.

107
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:56,070
There's not much
interesting happening here

108
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,900
apart from the "About You."

109
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,680
This is where you create a
user account for yourself.

110
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,930
I like using a user
with the name "Student,"

111
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,730
and I suggest you do the same

112
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,490
because throughout the
exercises in this course,

113
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:11,760
I will refer to the user account as well.

114
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,710
This user will be provided
with pseudo privileges as well.

115
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,950
And it means that this
user will have options

116
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,590
to do administrative work.

117
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,580
So, that's all.

118
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,520
Now you click "Start Using
Red Hat Enterprise Linux,"

119
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,793
and that'll bring you into the
main application interface.

120
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,870
I would suggest you to say, "No, thanks,"

121
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:37,380
on Take Tour to get access to your system.

122
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,050
We'll take care of the
registration later on as well.

123
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,493
For now, we are all good.
