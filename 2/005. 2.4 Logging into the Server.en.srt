1
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,440
- So at this point,

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,790
you should have a ready

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,600
to be used instance of
Red Hat enterprise Linux.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,010
What are we going to do with it?

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,073
Well, you first need to log into it.

6
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,290
To work on Linux,

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,270
you need to identify yourself,

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,570
and you do that by logging
in using a user account.

9
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:25,860
Let's know that procedure.

10
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,620
You do that on your own computer as well.

11
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,330
A user account is created when

12
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,280
the server installs.

13
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,860
Some service have a root user account

14
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,990
with unlimited access privileges,

15
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,930
and some service only have
a regular user account

16
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,530
that can perform administrative
tasks using sudo.

17
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,750
And some service have both.

18
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,220
The server that we have installed

19
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,910
in the previous video does
have a root user account,

20
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,500
and a regular user account.

21
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,300
And that's exactly what I need you to have

22
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,953
at this specific moment.

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,440
But I can already tell you

24
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,570
before we dive into further details

25
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,120
that you should avoid logging in as root,

26
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,590
because it has a higher risk

27
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,603
of security related problems.

28
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,120
So let me show you how to log in,

29
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,670
and what you can do after that.

30
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,960
Okay, so we can see the
student user account.

31
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,450
It's user account that I've created,

32
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,160
and you need to enter a password

33
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,200
for that student user account.

34
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,370
And that will bring you

35
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,980
into the graphical user interface.

36
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,510
For now, please ignore the message

37
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:30,960
about the system that
has not been registered.

38
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,423
We are only going to do that much later.

39
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,610
So what we see here is
what we call the GNOME

40
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,440
graphical user interface.

41
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,090
And in this interface,

42
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,370
well, there's only one
thing that really matters,

43
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,870
and that's a terminal,

44
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,040
because in the terminal,

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,923
you are going to do
everything you need for RHCSA.

46
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,553
So at this point,

47
00:01:52,553 --> 00:01:53,910
you are ready to get started

48
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,100
with Red Hat enterprise Linux.

49
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,360
In the next lesson,

50
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,673
you will learn what to
do once you are here.
