00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,760
- Welcome to lesson two,

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,640
installing Red Hat
Enterprise Linux server.

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,350
In this lesson, you'll
learn what is needed

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,770
to install Red Hat Enterprise
Linux in your environment.

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,010
I'll first explain what is
needed to install RHEL nine.

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,430
After which, we can cover the
actual installation itself.

7
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,410
I'll cover all the
parameters that are needed

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,030
to set up a basic system,

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,620
which also includes an installation

10
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,309
with custom partitioning.

11
00:00:30,309 --> 00:00:32,760
You'll also learn how to deploy a Red Hat

12
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,080
in a Cloud environment.

13
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,300
And when we reach the end of this lesson,

14
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,050
you'll have your own environment
that is ready for use.

15
00:00:40,112 --> 00:00:42,420
At the end of this
lesson, you'll find a lab

16
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,490
that allows you to
practice RHEL installation,

17
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:45,993
as well as the lab solution.
