1
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:07,403
- All right.

2
00:00:07,403 --> 00:00:09,450
Let's talk about server requirements.

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,190
So, what you are going to need

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,730
to install Red Hat Enterprise
Linux really depends

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,640
on the type of insulation
that you are going to do.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,981
So, is it a physical, a cloud,
or a virtual insulation?

7
00:00:20,981 --> 00:00:24,810
Are you going to use a
graphical user interface or not?

8
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,690
And what exactly are you
going to do with the server?

9
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,733
And if you have the
answers to all of these,

10
00:00:29,733 --> 00:00:33,360
then you can talk about your requirements.

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,120
Now for this class, we
will make it really simple.

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,140
I recommend you use a virtual machine

13
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,740
with the following specs.

14
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,000
So, here are the requirements

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,490
for installation in this class.

16
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,340
To start with, you need at
least two gigabytes of RAM.

17
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,710
You are going to need a
graphical user interface,

18
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,889
and that doesn't work well if
you only have one gigabyte.

19
00:00:52,889 --> 00:00:56,820
Make sure you have 20
gigabytes of disk space.

20
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,730
Also, make sure you have
a network connection

21
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,300
and an optical drive
or access to a DVD ISO.

22
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,260
In the next video,

23
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,813
you will learn how to
perform a basic installation.
