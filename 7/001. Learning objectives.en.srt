00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,450
- Howdy! Welcome to lesson seven.

2
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,480
This lesson is all about
managing text files.

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,660
I'll first tell you about
some of the common text tools.

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,490
Then it's time to talk about grep,

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,110
one of the most important commands

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,090
that you'll work with on Linux.

7
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,710
Next, you'll learn how to make grep

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,780
and other tools even more powerful

9
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,730
by using regular expressions.

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,620
And after that, we'll have a look at awk

11
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,390
and the sed utility.

12
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,860
This lesson ends with the lab

13
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,143
and I'll also show you the lab solution.
