00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,390
- In this video, I wanna talk about awk.

2
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,190
So what is awk?

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,910
Well, awk is a very powerful
text processing utility

4
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,120
that is specialized in data
extraction and reporting.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,180
It was developed in the late 1970s

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,130
when computers normally didn't even have

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,350
a screen attached to it

8
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,800
and you needed to perform
your operations line based.

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,840
And that is where awk is coming from.

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,240
So very powerful in analyzing fails

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,420
and performing operations
on specific lines.

12
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,800
And these operations are
performed based on selectors.

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,440
Now, there are so many things
that you can do at awk,

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,890
but most of these things
have lost their usefulness.

15
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,590
I am going to show you
a couple of examples

16
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,033
which I consider useful.

17
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,390
Okay, our first example
is awk minus F, a colon.

18
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,180
That's the field separator in awk,

19
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,613
and I am using print,

20
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,080
dollar four on etc passwd,

21
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,650
which is giving what?

22
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,030
Well, it's giving user IDs.

23
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,773
I'll tell you about these later.

24
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,070
Now, let me show you how
awk can become useful

25
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:22,070
using awk minus F colon, and
next between single quotes,

26
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:27,600
I'm putting student and
them between curly braces,

27
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,643
print dollar four,

28
00:01:32,093 --> 00:01:35,100
etc passedwd,

29
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,180
which is doing what?

30
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,320
It's printing dollar four

31
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,230
but only for lines at max, a text student.

32
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,890
And in fact, this is something that

33
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,710
is actually a pretty
complex scripting operation

34
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,473
in one single line in awk.

35
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,311
Also pretty common is the NF.

36
00:01:54,311 --> 00:01:59,311
Now what is NF, if I use awk
print dollar NF, etc passwd.

37
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,240
Showing the last field.

38
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,150
This dollar NF is the
last field in the line.

39
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,230
And that's very convenient

40
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:13,143
if you don't know exactly
how many fields there are.
