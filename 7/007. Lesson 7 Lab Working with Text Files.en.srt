00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,880
- Once again, we are at
the end of the lesson.

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,470
Let's do a lab.

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,120
So to start with, use head and tail

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,870
to display the fifth line
of the file /etc/passwd.

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,900
Next, you do something
similar, this time using sed.

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,540
Then, use awk in a pipe
to filter the last column

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,420
out of the results of the command ps aux.

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,570
Use grep to show the
names of files in /etc

9
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,780
that have lines that contain
the text "root" as a word.

10
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,200
And use grep to show all
lines from all files in /etc

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,230
that contain exactly three characters.

12
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,930
And finally, use grep to find all files

13
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,310
that contain the string "alex"

14
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,130
but make sure that
"alexander" is not included

15
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,270
in the result.

16
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,103
Good luck.
