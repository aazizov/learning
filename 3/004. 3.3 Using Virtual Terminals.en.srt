00:00:06,558 --> 00:00:09,480
- In this video, I will tell
you about a special feature

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,940
in Linux, the virtual terminal.

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,560
So what is a terminal?

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,977
Well, a terminal is the
most important environment

5
00:00:15,977 --> 00:00:17,640
that you are going to use.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,130
It's the environment that runs a shell.

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,650
In a graphical environment,
multiple terminals

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,600
can be used on the same screen.

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,630
And that is why, even
if it's not very useful,

10
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,073
most Linux administrates like
graphical environments anyway.

11
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:34,110
In a text based environment,

12
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,080
only one terminal is
started from the console.

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,230
And that means that you can
see one thing at a time.

14
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,600
That's inconvenient
and that is why we have

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,670
virtual terminals.

16
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,650
Virtual terminals can be used to start

17
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,590
additional terminal sessions
and they are accessible

18
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,400
by using Ctrl[-Alt]-Fn
key keyboard sequences.

19
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,170
Like Ctrl[-Alt]-F2,

20
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,690
which is where your
graphical interface is hiding

21
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,793
or Ctrl[-Alt]-F3 up to F6

22
00:01:00,793 --> 00:01:04,503
where you have some text
based terminals hiding.

23
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,580
Now, how do we work with
these virtual terminals>

24
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,340
Well you use the who or the w command

25
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,280
to see which users currently
are active on which terminals?

26
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,879
And you can use chvt for
change virtual terminal

27
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:20,430
to change between virtual terminals

28
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,550
or obviously you use the key sequences.

29
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:24,480
But in particular,

30
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,760
if you are in a virtualized environment

31
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,970
these key sequences are
not always accessible.

32
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,233
Let's go check this out.

33
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,110
All right, let me start by typing who,

34
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,793
where I can see that I'm user
student connected to tty2.

35
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:45,630
Tty is the name of the terminal.

36
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,990
Devices in Linux always
have a device name and tty2

37
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,070
happens to be the device name
for your standard terminal.

38
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,030
Now, if I would use chvt 3,

39
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,620
now what is going to happen?

40
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,696
Oh, something nasty has happened.

41
00:02:00,696 --> 00:02:04,590
Couldn't get a file descriptor
referring to the console.

42
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,933
And you know why that is?

43
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:08,250
That is because I'm running this command

44
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,113
without root privileges.

45
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,140
We'll cover it later in more detail,

46
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,307
but already I want to tell you about sudo,

47
00:02:17,307 --> 00:02:19,020
but before I type sudo,

48
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,180
I need to type sudo in
front of the command.

49
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,760
And now my cursor is to
the end of the command.

50
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,670
I like using the control 'A' key sequence

51
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,580
which brings my cursor to
the front of the command

52
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,650
which allows for easy editing.

53
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,700
And now I'm using sudo
chvt for super use sudo.

54
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,390
So with root privileges, run this command.

55
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,160
So here is my other terminal.

56
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,970
I use my username and password to log in,

57
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,120
and now I type who to
see who is logged in.

58
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,420
And there I can see that
I'm logged in on tty2

59
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,100
as well tty3.

60
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,510
And you know what, if
I do a sudo chvt again

61
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,982
to change to terminal four,

62
00:02:59,982 --> 00:03:03,570
then it's asking for my password again.

63
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,220
And I have new login prompt.

64
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,520
And this new login prompt
is where I'm going to log in

65
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,340
as root and as root I'm going to type

66
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,400
the shortest command available, w.

67
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,820
'W' is giving kind of the same information

68
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,430
as the who command but
it's not only telling you

69
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,980
who is logged in and
where they are logged in.

70
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,710
It's also giving some more
environmental information

71
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,660
about these users.

72
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,345
Next I'm going to use chvt 2

73
00:03:30,345 --> 00:03:34,320
and chvt 2 is bringing me
back to the graphical screen.

74
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,700
That's where it all started.

75
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,110
And this is all you need to know

76
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,973
about these virtual terminals.
