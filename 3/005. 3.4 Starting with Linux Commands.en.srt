00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:07,463
- In this video

2
00:00:07,463 --> 00:00:10,293
I want to introduce how to
work with Linux commands.

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,400
So Linux commands, there are many of them

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,410
and they all have common properties

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,260
and this video is just
about the common properties.

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,990
So most commands can
be used with arguments

7
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,140
and these arguments
further specify the use

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,610
of the command.

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,910
Options can be used to modify
the behavior of the commands

10
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,340
and to get a short usage overview,

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,340
use --help with the command.

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,030
And before I'm going to
show you how to use this,

13
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,020
one more thing.

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,870
Linux is case sensitive.

15
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,960
Almost all of the commands
are written in lowercase.

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,370
Make sure you respect the case,

17
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,113
because otherwise it won't work.

18
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,240
So, I'm on the command line right now.

19
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,360
And let's talk about ls,

20
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,940
ls is a command that lists files.

21
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,393
And if you want to know how it works,

22
00:01:02,393 --> 00:01:05,340
use ls --help.

23
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,260
I like this --help a lot,

24
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,210
because it's showing a lot of information

25
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,760
about what you can do, sometimes so much

26
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,773
that it doesn't even fit on the screen.

27
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,250
If that happens, use a pipe sign

28
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,200
and send it to the less command.

29
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,540
We'll talk about these
in more detail later,

30
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,790
but that allows you to
see, screen by screen

31
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,110
what is happening.

32
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,370
And what do we see?

33
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:30,000
We see that ls has many,
many options, like -a,

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,737
which is equivalent to --o.

35
00:01:32,737 --> 00:01:34,800
- a is what you call the short option,

36
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,340
the --o, you guessed
it, it's a long option.

37
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,580
They have exactly the same function.

38
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,840
So sometimes you can use

39
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,820
either the short or the long option.

40
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,370
Sometimes there is only a short option,

41
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,940
like right here for -f, or
there's only a long option,

42
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,030
like right here for the block size.

43
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,980
The nice thing is that this help system

44
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,432
will always tell you about it.

45
00:01:57,432 --> 00:01:59,640
So what is the result?

46
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,270
Well, if I use ls -a, I see all files.

47
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,380
And all files,

48
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,190
that includes files that have
name starting with a dot.

49
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,200
We call those hidden files,

50
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,400
and, hey, what's the
difference with ls --o?

51
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,810
Well, it's just more typing,

52
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,600
but for the rest of it,
there is no difference.

53
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,910
We'll explore these
Linux commands a lot more

54
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,230
and you will learn a lot more

55
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,453
about them in the upcoming lessons.
