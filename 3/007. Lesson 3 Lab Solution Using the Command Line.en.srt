1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,150
- So here is what I needed
you to do for the lab.

2
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,620
You needed to log in.

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,570
Uh oh, we're already logged in.

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,490
Let's fix that in the upper right corner

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,380
you can see the play button,

6
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:18,810
and there is a log out option.

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,690
So, I am going to use log out

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,663
and that is going to log me out.

9
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,820
Now you can see that the
login screen is loading again

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,820
and I can click on my user
account and enter my password.

11
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,390
And then I'm back in the
graphical environment

12
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,700
in which I'm going to use
the search bar this time

13
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,193
to activate the terminal.

14
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,060
I do need to change the
settings of the terminal

15
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,180
and that's unfortunately
something that's not remembered.

16
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,900
So you need to resize the fonts and so on.

17
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,400
And I'm going to use who.

18
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,630
Hey that's interesting,

19
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,040
you have seen me logging out,

20
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,620
and while I logged out from tty2,

21
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:08,610
the sessions on tty3 and
tty4 have not been affected.

22
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,850
That's normal, but it's
something to be aware of,

23
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,090
because it means that
you might easily forget

24
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,340
about these sessions that are still open.

25
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,851
And if you do, that might be risky

26
00:01:20,851 --> 00:01:22,983
from a security point of view.

27
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,940
So how about who minus minus help?

28
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,100
Who minus minus help is telling me

29
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,790
about all of these fantastic
options that can be used.

30
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,130
They don't matter at this point for now.

31
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,753
This is all I needed you to do.
