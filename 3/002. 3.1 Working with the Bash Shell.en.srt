00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,670
- In this video I will
show you how to work with

2
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,080
the bash shell.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,710
But first we need to explore
what exactly the shell is.

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,410
Well, the shell is the environment
where the user interfaces

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,210
with the operating system.

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,763
Briefly, that's where
you type your commands.

7
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,600
Bash is the default command line shell,

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,820
and that is the place
where you will be spending

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:27,873
most of your time.

10
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,100
There's also a graphical
shell, which is known as GNOME,

11
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,783
or some people say GNOME.

12
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,120
From a graphical shell,

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,240
a terminal window running
bash can be started,

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,580
so you will end up with bash anyway.

15
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,770
And that's because the
bash shell is so powerful

16
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,870
and providing access to
all the functionality

17
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,543
that you will ever need
in your Linux environment.

18
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,630
So the bash shell provides many features

19
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,760
to make working with the shell easier.

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,190
And these include command line completion,

21
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,880
history, variables,
scripts, and much more.

22
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,590
We'll talk about these later.

23
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,750
So how do we use a shell?

24
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,300
Well before a user gets
access to the shell,

25
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,900
as we have already seen
the user must authenticate.

26
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,050
On a non-graphical system the
user will see a text prompt

27
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:15,540
asking for the user name and password.

28
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,460
And in a graphical shell,

29
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,220
the user can select the
account and password easily

30
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,440
from the graphical environment.

31
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,313
Let me show you.

32
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,850
So this is what the graphical
shell login looks like.

33
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,610
You see your account,
you type your password,

34
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:33,933
and then you are in.

35
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,840
Notice that the login procedure,

36
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,770
and the procedure to get
through your screen saver

37
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,950
are the same, the idea
is exactly the same.

38
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,140
So here you have the graphical environment

39
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,470
in which the shell terminal is open.

40
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,960
If you use Ctrl-Shift+

41
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,910
you can increase font size a little bit,

42
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,410
maybe you like that.

43
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:59,040
Let me also show you what a
non-graphical login looks like.

44
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,710
So in many cases you will be working

45
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,110
from a graphical environment,

46
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,500
but some systems come up with
a non-graphical environment,

47
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,993
and then this is what
your shell looks like.

48
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,250
And even if the environments
do look different

49
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,080
what counts is a command line.

50
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,420
Because no matter if it runs in a terminal

51
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,270
or in a completely text based shell

52
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,423
both of these are running the bash shell.
