00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,180
- All right, we are at the
end of yet another lesson.

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,830
Let's do a quick lab.

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,500
In this lab, you are going
to use the command line.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,490
To start with,

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:15,990
log into the graphical system

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,090
using your default user account

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,450
and open a terminal window
and type the who command

8
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,820
to find out which users are active.

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,400
And actually use who --help

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,583
to get a short usage
overview for this command.
