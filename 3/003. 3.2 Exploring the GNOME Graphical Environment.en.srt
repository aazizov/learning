1
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,553
- All right.

2
00:00:07,553 --> 00:00:10,878
So here we are in the GNOME
graphical environment.

3
00:00:10,878 --> 00:00:13,530
In this class, I definitely
don't want to teach you

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,570
about the GNOME graphical environment

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,076
because most Linux services
you will be working

6
00:00:18,076 --> 00:00:21,060
with aren't using any GNOME at all.

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,610
So let me start with the
most important thing.

8
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,710
There we go, Terminal.

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:26,850
If you double click

10
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,850
on the errors bar and then
use control shift, plus

11
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:33,270
you can increase the font
size to make it more readable.

12
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,260
And that is what your
terminal is all about.

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,345
If there's more that you wanna do

14
00:00:39,345 --> 00:00:42,513
you can go to the terminal settings.

15
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,430
And these settings are

16
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,643
in the upper right
corner, under preferences.

17
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,970
And there's just one
thing that I wanna do.

18
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,470
I want to go to the profile.

19
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,600
My current profile is unnamed

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,090
and I want to disable the terminal bell

21
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,340
because otherwise you'll hear a sound

22
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,640
anytime you make an error
and that's just annoying.

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,910
Another thing that you might
like to do is in colors.

24
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:09,000
If you unselect use
colors from system theme

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,300
then you get this black
on a white background.

26
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,510
I like it because it's a
little bit more readable

27
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,370
so I'm going to keep that.

28
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,804
Now, I want to show you two more things

29
00:01:19,804 --> 00:01:21,330
and in order to get there

30
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,840
I'm clicking in the upper
left corner on activities.

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,630
You can see my terminal is
becoming a little bit smaller

32
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,640
and we have this type two search.

33
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,260
This is a search bar

34
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,990
and like any modern operating system

35
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,330
you can just type what
you want to look for.

36
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,440
Well, I want to look

37
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,590
for my power settings and
know that it's not power off,

38
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,373
it's the second one, power
in the settings right here.

39
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,950
I'm clicking that just to make sure

40
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,530
that I have this screen blank

41
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,450
which happens after five minutes.

42
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,570
I don't want it to
blank after five minutes

43
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,700
I want it to blank never.

44
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,610
And that is about all that we need.

45
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,950
So if you know how to use a search option,

46
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,440
if you know where to find your terminal

47
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,730
then you will be good.

48
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:13,170
For the rest of it in this
class and also for RHCSA,

49
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,030
we are really not going to do a lot

50
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,103
in a GNOME graphical environment.
