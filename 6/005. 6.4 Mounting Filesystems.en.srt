00:00:05,967 --> 00:00:07,110
- In this video,

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,113
I will tell you about
mounting file systems.

3
00:00:10,113 --> 00:00:13,050
So mounting file systems is essential

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,113
for the file system hierarchy.

5
00:00:15,113 --> 00:00:16,590
What is it about?

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,170
Well, if you are using a device,

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,240
it must be connected to a directory.

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,630
So, if you have a USB
thumb drive, for instance,

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:25,800
you need to plug it in.

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,720
And before you can use it on Linux

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,690
you need to mount it on a directory.

12
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,670
And that is what this is about.

13
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,340
We call it mounting the device.

14
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,362
Now the Linux file system
typically uses multiple mounts,

15
00:00:38,362 --> 00:00:40,290
and different types of data

16
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,380
typically are on different
devices for multiple reasons,

17
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,810
like security, like manageability

18
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,600
and like specific mount options.

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,820
You may remember that
earlier in this course

20
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,940
we have installed a server
with custom partitioning.

21
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,470
And custom partitioning means that

22
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,322
you create a partition that you
mount on a specific location

23
00:00:58,322 --> 00:01:02,610
to provide some additional
protection for your data.

24
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,920
Now, in order to mount a device manually

25
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,560
you can use a mount command that looks

26
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,720
like mount/dev/devicename,

27
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,760
and you mount it on a directory

28
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,671
like mount/dev/sdb1/mnt.

29
00:01:14,671 --> 00:01:17,280
You insert a USB thumb drive,

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,380
typically you will see a device popping up

31
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,084
with the name sdb1, and
you want to access it,

32
00:01:22,084 --> 00:01:24,210
put it on a directory

33
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,324
and mnt, /mnt is the most common directory

34
00:01:27,324 --> 00:01:30,243
that is often used for mounting devices.

35
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,404
Convenient in this context
is to findmnt command.

36
00:01:34,404 --> 00:01:37,890
Findmnt finds all that is
mounted at this moment.

37
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,170
And will give you a nice insight

38
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,480
of which device is on which directory

39
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,240
and it'll show you how your
current file system hierarchy

40
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,380
which shows as one,

41
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,130
is really spread over multiple
devices on your system.

42
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,390
Let's have a quick look

43
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,670
and do notice that
these topics are covered

44
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,953
in much more depth later in this course.

45
00:01:58,454 --> 00:02:00,570
Let me show you findmnt

46
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,910
What do we find in findmnt?

47
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,070
We see in the left column directories,

48
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,080
and then we see what is mounted

49
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,300
on that specific directory.

50
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,730
In the output, there's
a lot of system mounts,

51
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,030
but there's also the /boot directory,

52
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,940
which is using /dev/sda1.

53
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,990
That means that if you go

54
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:22,590
to the /boot directory
and I type ls there,

55
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:26,610
then really we are on a
different device /dev/sda1.

56
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,430
If there are devices
that are not mounted yet,

57
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,920
another way to have look at them is lsblk,

58
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,573
for list block devices.

59
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,370
And this will show all the
devices available on this system.

60
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,690
There aren't very many,

61
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,344
because this is a very basic system

62
00:02:45,344 --> 00:02:48,210
without much additional configuration,

63
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,610
but by the time you
start creating partitions

64
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,960
and logical volumes,

65
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,734
this lsblk command is going to
be a very important command.

66
00:02:55,734 --> 00:02:57,120
And you know what?

67
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,414
You can even try to do a
manual mount, mount /dev/sda1.

68
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:04,080
/sda1 is already mounted on /boot.

69
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,290
I am going to mount it again on /mnt.

70
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,360
And as you can see, that is something

71
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,930
that is just allowed by
the Linux operating system.

72
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,760
But before this is giving me anything

73
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,940
that I am not expecting,
let me umount it again

74
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,210
to disconnect the mount,
which is required,

75
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,943
if ever you need to remove
the device, for instance.
