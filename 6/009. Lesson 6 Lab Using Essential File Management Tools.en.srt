00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,670
- In this lesson, we'll do a lab.

2
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,910
The lab is about using
essential file management tools.

3
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,670
To start it, you start to
create a compressed archive

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,760
for all the files in the
etc and opt directories.

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,370
And write this archive
to your home directory.

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,350
Then, create a symbolic
link to the archive

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,380
you've just created in the tmp directory,

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,720
and remove the archive
from the home directory,

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,053
and check what happens
through the symbolic link.
