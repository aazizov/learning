1
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,120
- So, the first part is
to create an archive,

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,260
a compressed archive.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,025
So, let's use tar czvf,

4
00:00:13,025 --> 00:00:15,210
(computer keyboard clacking)

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,753
and I need to specify where to.

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,880
Well, I want to write
it to my home directory,

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,150
so let's call it lab6.tgz

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,810
and we are putting /etc and /opt in there.

9
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,300
Are you noticing anything
about this command?

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,530
Well, you should,

11
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,700
because I did not use a
hyphen in front of the options

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,690
and that's kind of funny.

13
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,600
There's a few commands on Linux,

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,140
tar and ps are the best
known of these commands,

15
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,593
that work with options with
as well as without a hyphen.

16
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,410
There's history behind it.

17
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:56,550
You just need to be aware

18
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,200
that if you see on the tar command

19
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,330
that somebody is not using their options,

20
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,250
well, it's just working.

21
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,680
Now we wanna know if this
worked out all right.

22
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,048
So let's use tar tvf

23
00:01:07,048 --> 00:01:10,260
(computer keyboard clacking)

24
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,498
on lab6.tgz.

25
00:01:11,498 --> 00:01:12,900
(computer keyboard clacking)

26
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,140
And there we can see it
is working perfectly.

27
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,910
Next we need to create a symbolic link

28
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:21,450
to the archive you've just
created in the tmp directory.

29
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,540
So the symbolic link must
be in the tmp directory.

30
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,200
So ln -s is how we create symbolic link,

31
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,914
lab6.tzg/tmp/lab6.link,

32
00:01:32,914 --> 00:01:36,664
(computer keyboard clacking)

33
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,810
and then the question was

34
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,720
to remove the archive
from your home directory.

35
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,720
So rm lab6.tzg, and then
what happens to the link?

36
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:53,190
Well, ls -l on /tmp/lab6.link,

37
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:56,940
and we can see that the link is invalid.

38
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,240
The ls command is using convenient core,

39
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,780
so that it's easy to recognize
that this is an invalid link.

40
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,213
Otherwise, if you try to
access this /tmp/lab6.link,

41
00:02:08,213 --> 00:02:10,950
(computer keyboard clacking)

42
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,120
no matter which command

43
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,580
you get a "no such file or directory".

44
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,530
That might be confusing about links

45
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,170
because sometimes you get
"no such file or directory",

46
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,460
but, "Hey, I see the file."

47
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,770
Yeah, but that's because it is a link.

48
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,050
Also notice in the output of ls,

49
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,320
the very first character all
the way to the left is an L,

50
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,203
and the L indicates that
this is a symbolic link.
