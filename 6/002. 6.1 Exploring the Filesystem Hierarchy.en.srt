1
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,230
- The Linux Filesystem
Hierarchy is very organized.

2
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,993
So let's talk about this standardization

3
00:00:12,993 --> 00:00:16,080
before diving into the details.

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,653
The Linux Filesystem
is highly standardized

5
00:00:18,653 --> 00:00:20,550
standard directly so defined

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,760
in the Filesystem
Hierarchy standard or FHS.

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,480
And its FHS was defined
by Linux Foundation.

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,550
Linux Foundation is the organization

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,890
behind all the Linux distributions.

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,950
And their main mission is
to keep standardization

11
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,170
between the different distributions

12
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,480
to make sure that even
if all the distributions

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,680
are slightly different, Linux
looks and fuels the same.

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,050
The link to the Filesystem
Hierarchy standard

15
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,900
is on the slight that
you can see right now.

16
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,100
I would say, check it out

17
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,620
if you are looking for any details.

18
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,950
The starting point of the
Filesystem is the route directory.

19
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,230
And in this route
directory different devices

20
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,870
might be integrated by using mounts.

21
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,700
I'll tell you about these mounts later,

22
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,610
but before continuing, I'd
like to show you a little bit

23
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,523
of what is going on in
Filesystem hierarchy standard.

24
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,550
So I'm using CD slash to
go to the root directory

25
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,790
because this root directory
is represented as a slash.

26
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,740
Then when we type LS

27
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,780
we can see all the directories existing

28
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,550
in this root directory.

29
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,400
Let's not try to cover all
of them at this moment.

30
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,560
We'll talk about them when it is needed.

31
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,610
Just a couple of them

32
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,660
the etc directory changing
directory, and I'm typing LS.

33
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,850
This is for configuration files

34
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,100
or the USR directory.

35
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,620
That's like your program
fails on windows here.

36
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,890
You can find all your
binaries, nicely organized

37
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,980
and user bin and user sbin where sbin

38
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,190
is super user binary
requiring a root privileges

39
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,760
and bin are the binaries
that would be documented

40
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,403
in section one of the
main page, if you want.

41
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,890
What else do we have?

42
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,260
Well another one that is pretty important

43
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,180
is the VAR directory.

44
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,960
The VAR directory is
used for temporary stuff

45
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,100
for a long time VAR log has
been a very important directory

46
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,050
containing log files,

47
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,450
but nowadays, as you will learn later

48
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,190
journal D is taking over

49
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,283
in journal D keeps its log somewhere else.

50
00:02:20,283 --> 00:02:25,140
Also there's the TMP directory
TMPs for temporary files,

51
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,870
and this is the only
directory apart from the user

52
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,690
home directory, where any user can write.

53
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:34,320
If you want to check it, you
touch to create an empty file

54
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,150
with the name hello in this case

55
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,970
and look at that, start hello
is leading to me writing

56
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,340
a file with the name, hello.

57
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,220
Last but not least there's
the user home directory,

58
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,860
this type CD without anything behind it.

59
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,520
And you'll get automatically
into your user home directory

60
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,940
which can be verified if you type pwd,

61
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,930
if you wanna know more

62
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,650
about directories and which
is used for what type,

63
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,410
man hier, hier for hierarchy

64
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,090
this is the man page that is based

65
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,400
on the filesystem hierarchy standard,

66
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,900
and you will find it on Reddit

67
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,180
and it contains good documentation

68
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,960
of all of these directories,
including sub directory levels

69
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,093
and what exactly they are used for.

70
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,120
Now, this is one example

71
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,790
of why C also in man pages can be useful.

72
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:21,623
Do you see that?

73
00:03:21,623 --> 00:03:25,080
That's man page file
hierarchy in section seven,

74
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,820
section seven is for diverse
kinds of documentation.

75
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,750
So if I use man on file hierarchy

76
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,000
then what are we going to get?

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,170
Now look at that.

78
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,940
We get a nice overview

79
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:43,623
of the way our Filesystem
hierarchy standard is organized.

80
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,650
It's a little bit of automatic approach

81
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,420
and you might like this approach

82
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,453
with more a documentation
about what is going on.
