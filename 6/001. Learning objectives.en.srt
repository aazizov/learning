00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,390
- Hello, and welcome to lesson six.

2
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,750
This lesson is about essential
file management tasks.

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,510
You'll first learn about
the file system hierarchy.

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,400
Next, we'll explore the essential commands

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,915
for managing files.

6
00:00:18,915 --> 00:00:21,600
Once you've learned how
to copy and move files,

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,100
I'll show you how to find files

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,530
and mount file systems in the hierarchy.

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,810
After that, you'll learn
how to work with links,

10
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,160
archive files with tar,

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,170
and how to work with compressed files.

12
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,370
And at the end of this lesson,

13
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:34,230
you find a lab, which will guide you

14
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,843
through some of the essential
file management tasks.
