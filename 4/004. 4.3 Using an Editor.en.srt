1
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,910
- Another thing that is
really essential to know about

2
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,760
while working with Linux is the editor.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,340
So let's talk about editors a bit.

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,260
Why are editors so important?

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,116
Well, editors are important
because Linux configuration

6
00:00:19,116 --> 00:00:22,980
happens normally by modifying text files.

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,403
Plain ASCII text is used for many files.

8
00:00:26,403 --> 00:00:29,700
But there are some alternatives
as well, like YAML,

9
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,150
which is common in configuration
management, like Ansible.

10
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:37,560
Or JSON, which is used often
as a data storage format.

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,653
Or XML which can be used as an
alternative to JSON and YAML.

12
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,840
In order to use all of these
files, you need an editor.

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,120
And editors can modify text files

14
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,240
without adding any formatting code.

15
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,054
That is what is important about editors.

16
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,467
There are two common editors on Linux,

17
00:00:56,467 --> 00:00:58,773
and these are nano and vim.

18
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,286
Let's talk a little bit about nano.

19
00:01:02,286 --> 00:01:05,460
Nano is the easy-to-use editor.

20
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,940
After starting it, you can
start editing text immediately.

21
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,062
And commands are shown
as keyboard shortcuts

22
00:01:11,062 --> 00:01:13,530
in the lower part of the screen.

23
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:14,733
Let's go check it out.

24
00:01:17,623 --> 00:01:21,443
All right, let me type nano, my file.

25
00:01:21,443 --> 00:01:23,970
When I'm using an
editor, I like to specify

26
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,980
the name of the file that I want to edit

27
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:30,011
or if the file does not exist,
the file I want to create.

28
00:01:30,011 --> 00:01:31,920
So I'm using nano, my file

29
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,083
and this is bringing
me the nano interface.

30
00:01:35,258 --> 00:01:37,814
What is so convenient about nano?

31
00:01:37,814 --> 00:01:41,760
Well, I can start typing
my text immediately,

32
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,390
like, hello, this is my file.

33
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,510
And, we can see all the available options

34
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,640
in the lower part of the screen.

35
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,110
There are two types of options.

36
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,920
There are options that start with caret.

37
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,740
Caret is control sign.

38
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,000
So control X is what you
are going to use to exit.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,298
There are also options that start with

40
00:02:02,298 --> 00:02:04,530
what we call the meta key.

41
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,803
The meta key on most
keyboards is the alt key.

42
00:02:08,717 --> 00:02:10,284
You won't use them very much.

43
00:02:10,284 --> 00:02:14,370
The most often used option is control X.

44
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,644
So let me do a control X.

45
00:02:16,644 --> 00:02:20,130
The rest of it is happening in
the lower part of the screen.

46
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,762
So, save modified buffer?

47
00:02:21,762 --> 00:02:23,094
Yes.

48
00:02:23,094 --> 00:02:26,640
So, as you can see, I
need to press Y for yes.

49
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,380
And then, a file name to write,

50
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,540
well, I already provided a file name

51
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,260
so, I'm just pressing enter
and the file has been saved.

52
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,280
Can we check that?

53
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,330
Yes, we can.

54
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,970
LS minus L on my file.

55
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:39,990
And did you see that?

56
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,790
This is what we call best completion,

57
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,640
I'm typing an M, then,
I press the tab key,

58
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,680
and as I have one file only

59
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,510
that has a name starting with an M.

60
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,110
Here, we can see the file exists

61
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,180
and that's the file that we just created.

62
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,360
And that's how easy it
is to work with nano.

63
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,840
But still, even if nano is so very easy,

64
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,150
most people are using another editor.

65
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,493
Let's talk about the other editor.
