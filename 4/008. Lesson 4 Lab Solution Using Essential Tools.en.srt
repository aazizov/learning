1
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,610
- Okay, so if you need to find a man page,

2
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,550
man -k is probably what you want to know.

3
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,880
man -k password, is that
bringing what we want?

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,790
Oh boy, that's a lot of information,

5
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,460
and in this lot of information

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,130
can we filter it down in a convenient way?

7
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,770
I think so, let's use Q to get out,

8
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,993
and let's use grep 1,

9
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,770
because changing a password, well,

10
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,570
that might be something that
relates to section number one.

11
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,310
And I don't see anything

12
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,400
that looks like what I'm looking for,

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,000
so maybe we need to look
in section number eight.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,200
Does that make sense?

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,920
Well, maybe this command
that I'm looking for

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,493
is a command that works for the root user

17
00:00:55,493 --> 00:00:57,900
as well as an ordinary user.

18
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,060
Now, what do we see here?

19
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,770
Well, you see something nasty

20
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,750
and that is that man -k in this
case is not so very useful,

21
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,990
because I don't know if
you see any useful command

22
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,600
but I don't see the command
that I'm looking for.

23
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,950
So let me cheat and show you man passwd.

24
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,240
What do we see?

25
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,577
We see that the man passwd's showing,

26
00:01:21,577 --> 00:01:24,450
"update users authentication token".

27
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,390
Now, you know what, man -k is looking

28
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,640
in the line that I have
highlighted right here.

29
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,100
And do you see the word password? I don't.

30
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,220
And that's why we don't see
it in the results either.

31
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,332
But if I would use man -k authentication,

32
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:42,210
(computer keyboard clacking)

33
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,740
then this is what we get.

34
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,570
And in man -k authentication,
yeah, there we see passwd.

35
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,810
Anyway, passwd is what we want.

36
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,550
Then use the man page for useradd,

37
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,983
and create a user with the name anna.

38
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,950
So man useradd,

39
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,450
here we can see this, the
description, the synopsis,

40
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,180
and in the synopsis, we
see the different users.

41
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,270
So I need useradd LOGIN.

42
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,680
Now what this is LOGIN?

43
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,913
Well, if you don't know,

44
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:13,860
you can get it from the description.

45
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,953
It will create a user
with a specific name.

46
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,620
Do notice that useradd
is in section eight,

47
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,620
so that means that useradd anna
is not going to be working,

48
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,090
permission denied.

49
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,860
We need to repeat that last command.

50
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,900
Let me do that by
pressing the up arrow key,

51
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,050
Control + A to bring
my cursor to the front,

52
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,390
and then I'm using sudo useradd anna

53
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,520
and that's doing so much better.

54
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,120
At least, after entering
the appropriate password.

55
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,480
So I created the user and likewise,

56
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,260
I'm going to use sudo passwd anna.

57
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,160
Why is that?

58
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,170
Well, do you really
think that ordinary users

59
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,180
can change one another's password?

60
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,140
Of course not, that's why we
need sudo superpowers here.

61
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,390
So it's prompting for the new password,

62
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,130
going once, going twice,

63
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,970
and now all authentication
tokens updated successfully.

64
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,800
That's good news.

65
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,630
The last part of this exercise,

66
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:15,810
use VIM to create a file
with the name users.

67
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,850
I'm using I for input mode

68
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:21,360
and I'm entering "alex" and "alexander"

69
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,750
and "linda" and "belinda".

70
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,870
And that is all that we need for now.

71
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,850
So I'm pressing Escape,

72
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:33,630
and after pressing Escape, I'm using :wq!.

73
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,127
Well, let me tell you, I'm
going to use a shortcut.

74
00:03:39,127 --> 00:03:42,540
"ZZ", which will do exactly the same.

75
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,940
Now my file is written, committed to disc,

76
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:49,710
and we can see that right
here when I'm using ls -l.

77
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:53,730
Vim users, there we go,
here is the users file.

78
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,073
And that's all for this
lab, let's continue.
