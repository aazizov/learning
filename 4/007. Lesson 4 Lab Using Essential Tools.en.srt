1
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:07,883
- All right,

2
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:08,880
we are at the end of this lesson.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,560
Let's do a lab.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,850
Here's the lab.

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,830
To start with, you locate the man page

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,020
that shows how to set a password.

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,420
Then use a man page for useradd

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,730
and create a user with the name Anna.

9
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,840
And set a password for
user Anna to password.

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,140
And last, use vim to create
a file with the name users,

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,120
and make sure that it contains the names

12
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,050
Alex, Alexander, Linda, and
Belinda on separate lines.

13
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,610
This lesson is important,

14
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,763
because we are going to need
it in one of the next lessons.
