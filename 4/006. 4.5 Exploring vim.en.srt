00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,350
- Now, the most
inconvenient thing about VIM

2
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,480
is that you need to learn commands.

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,123
Let's go check out some of
the most common commands.

4
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,100
There is escape.

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,320
We talked about it, no
matter where you are

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,220
press escape and you are sure
that you're in command mode.

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,750
You can use I, or A if you
want, to enter the input mode.

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,900
Where I is for insert and A is for append,

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,380
which brings you after the
current cursor position.

10
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,250
O is also convenient, it opens
a new line in input mode.

11
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,910
and :wq, is for write and quit.

12
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,750
Do notice the command is :wq not :qw,

13
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,763
because you can't quit and then write.

14
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,860
Also useful is :q!, which will
quit without saving anything.

15
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,710
That's what you wanna do
if you really are not sure

16
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,970
and the only thing you know is that

17
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:03,390
you wanna get out of here
without messing anything up.

18
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,240
dd is common, it deletes a current line.

19
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,350
And yy, well, yank, which
is copy the current line.

20
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,930
And no matter if you've
just deleted or yanked it

21
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,960
you can use P to paste it,

22
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,230
to get it back at the current
position of the cursor.

23
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,620
V can be useful for visual mode, press V,

24
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,260
then you move your arrow keys
and you can make a selection.

25
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:29,280
And after making the selection,
you can delete it using D

26
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,070
or copy it using Y.

27
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,320
Also very convenient is U.

28
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,260
U for undo the last operation,

29
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,700
because if you are learning VIM,

30
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,590
you will notice that every now and then

31
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,090
something magical happens.

32
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,460
And you want to get out
of the magical environment

33
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,560
well, U, for undo.

34
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,510
Control+R is convenient as well,

35
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,123
that we will redo the last operation.

36
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:55,980
So, if you have undone something too much

37
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,083
use Control+R to get it back.

38
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,200
That's not all, there's a bit more.

39
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,960
Like gg, which will bring you
to the top of the document

40
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,770
or uppercase G, which will
go to the end of the document

41
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,120
or /text which will
search forward for text

42
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,993
or ?text, which will
search backwards for text.

43
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,280
Then there is caret, which
will bring you to the start

44
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,750
of the current line

45
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,110
or $, which will bring the
cursor to the end of the line.

46
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,350
There's also a W, which
will move to the next word.

47
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:33,350
And one of my favorites is :%s/old/new/g.

48
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,850
Which is a global substitute.

49
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:39,690
It'll change all occurrences
of the text, old with new.

50
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:40,983
Let's go check this out.

51
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:48,070
So, I'm using VIM, vimdemo.txt

52
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,750
And well, here we are on the top

53
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,600
and I am going to use,
O, for open a new line,

54
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,040
just because I wanted to show you

55
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,550
that my cursor is one line lower.

56
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:03,510
And what do I type?

57
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,580
I don't know.

58
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,400
This is what really
matters in demos like this.

59
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,260
This is a simple modification.

60
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,610
I'm just going to use my arrow keys to get

61
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,790
just behind the back slash

62
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,790
and I'm using backspace to remove it.

63
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:25,470
Now, let's go for
something more intelligent.

64
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,048
I'm using yy.

65
00:03:27,048 --> 00:03:27,900
What is yy?

66
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,960
Well, that is yank or a copy.

67
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,550
And then I'm using P, to paste.

68
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:39,000
Do notice that you can do
that as many times as you want

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,130
but you don't need to
forget to press escape

70
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,170
to get to command mode.

71
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,750
Hey, what I also like, and
which is not on the slide,

72
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:50,100
is :se number, that is
showing line numbers.

73
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,510
That can be convenient,

74
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,883
if you want to talk about specific line.

75
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:58,680
Now I'm going to use dd,
dd is deleting a line.

76
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,470
And instead of deleting individual lines,

77
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:05,130
you can use V for visual mode,
look at the lower left corner

78
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,640
which is showing that right
now, I have visual mode,

79
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,080
in which I can move my arrow
keys and press D for instance,

80
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,117
to delete everything or U, to undo,

81
00:04:16,117 --> 00:04:20,730
if you did not want to
delete it anyway, good.

82
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:24,450
Let me go to the top of
the document using G,

83
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:28,980
and I need to use the G twice, so gg.

84
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:33,980
And next I can show you my
favorite command, :%s/don't/do/g.

85
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,480
Do you see how nicely
VIM is highlighting it?

86
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,630
And now you can see that
everywhere where we had don't,

87
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:52,350
we now have do, and I
think I'm happy with this.

88
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:57,350
So I'm pressing escape,
:wq!, to write, quit

89
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,460
and get out of here.

90
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,470
Now, there is so much
more that can be done

91
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,770
in a VIM environment, but
I don't want to scare you.

92
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,020
I think this is enough for now.

93
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,490
That's one of the big risks

94
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:11,010
for people who are
getting started with VIM,

95
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,990
information overload.

96
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,850
If I may give you an advice,

97
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,880
practice the commands that
you have seen on the slides.

98
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,380
These are my favorites.

99
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,950
And apart from these comments,
the other ones that I know,

100
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,513
I don't use them that often.

101
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,480
There's one more thing
that I want to show you.

102
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,223
And that is VIM Tutor.

103
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,260
What is that?

104
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,140
Well, this is your online course in VIM.

105
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:39,140
Start reading and just do what
the comment is telling you.

106
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:42,180
Like J, for instance, to
bring your cursor down

107
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,400
and L to bring it to the right,

108
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,360
and there you are in lesson 1.2.

109
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,360
It's a good investment of
your time to use the VIM Tutor

110
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,360
a little bit, probably if you
use it for half an hour or so.

111
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,050
You have learned enough about
VIM to get yourself started.

112
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:05,160
But hey, in the end, use
whatever editor you like.

113
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,960
You're more comfortable with Nano?

114
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,250
That's okay as well.

115
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,910
Even if that means that you
are probably going to miss

116
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,283
all of the powerful features of VIM.
