1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,670
- Now, using man is convenient,

2
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,100
but what are you going to do
if you don't know what command

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,710
exactly you are looking for?

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,570
Well, in that case, you should know

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,350
that all man pages are
indexed in the mandb

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,650
and you can use man -k or alternatively

7
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,180
the apropos command to search
the mandb based on a keyword.

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,670
And that's convenient if you
don't know which command to use

9
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,830
but you do know the keyword.

10
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,680
In the output, you can
find a lot of results.

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,020
And if you get too many results,

12
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,490
you can use the grep command

13
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,380
in the pipe to filter the results.

14
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,853
I'll show you how that works.

15
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,480
But when working with
mandb, you should notice

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,230
that mandb is built automatically
through a scheduled task.

17
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,860
And sometimes you are looking
for something very obvious,

18
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,320
and you don't get any results.

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,870
Instead, it's telling
you nothing appropriate.

20
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,420
If that is going to happen,
then you need to manually

21
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,400
trigger a rebuild of the
mandb using sudo mandb.

22
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,633
Let's go check this out.

23
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:10,583
All right.

24
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:12,573
I'm using man -K user,

25
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,990
which is checking in the mandb

26
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,110
if there are any items about user.

27
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,690
Oh no, I am getting nothing appropriate.

28
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,570
Well, there's a very good
explanation for this.

29
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,880
This is a freshly installed system,

30
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,490
and on a newly installed system

31
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,410
your mandb command
hasn't been started yet.

32
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:35,243
And you know what?

33
00:01:35,243 --> 00:01:38,130
I already told you that
you should use sudo mandb.

34
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,860
But I think it's nice if we go check out

35
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,900
how to get to that information.

36
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,280
So, I'm using man man,
the man page for man

37
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,060
and now I'm going to search for -k.

38
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,283
So, that would be slash, look
at the lower left corner,

39
00:01:54,283 --> 00:01:56,730
- k, and then I press enter

40
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:59,490
and it's giving me the -k in the synopsis.

41
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,663
That's not what I want.

42
00:02:01,693 --> 00:02:04,350
What I want is what I see right here.

43
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,470
Remember, you can use N for next to repeat

44
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,290
the last search operation.

45
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:13,380
So, this is telling me a
short description equivalent

46
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,960
to apropos in bold.

47
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,610
The bold typeface indicates

48
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,950
that this is probably also a command.

49
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,310
So, I'm going to use man
apropos to get more information

50
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,320
about this apropos thing.

51
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,880
And in case you wouldn't know,

52
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,820
well, here you can see the apropos,

53
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,310
the database search by apropos is updated

54
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,130
by the mandb program.

55
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:38,220
And depending on the
installation, this may be run

56
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,220
by a periodic cron job or
need to be run manually.

57
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,890
So, that is exactly what's going on.

58
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,060
You wanna know more?

59
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,990
Type man mandb, the interesting
information right here

60
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,950
is the eight.

61
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,940
The eight is giving that this
is an administrator command

62
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,740
and being an administrator command,

63
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,810
I probably have to use sudo.

64
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,730
Let's try it without sudo first.

65
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:05,460
I'm using mandb, what do we get?

66
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:09,787
I am getting, oh boy,
I get "can't create,"

67
00:03:09,787 --> 00:03:11,280
"no such file."

68
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,990
I get lots of errors.

69
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,060
It's not so very obvious that these errors

70
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,020
are because I am not running
this with sudo privileges

71
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:23,070
but here we go using it
with sudo privileges.

72
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,100
And now we can see that it
is updating the index case

73
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,370
for all of these man pages.

74
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,630
Can take a little bit,

75
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,250
shouldn't be taking too long.

76
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,630
And once it is done,

77
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:37,530
after it has generated all of
this output, as you can see,

78
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:41,610
it has added almost 8,000
different man pages.

79
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:45,390
So, now I can try my man -k user again

80
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,370
and that is working and, oh boy,

81
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,143
that's a lot of information.

82
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:52,080
But if you look at all that information,

83
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,610
you can see that we have
results from different sections.

84
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,880
Like section two, which
is about system calls.

85
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,460
We do not care about system calls.

86
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:06,960
They don't matter if you are
into Linux administration.

87
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,610
If you wanna do administration,

88
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:11,460
you need to figure out what
is it that you want to do?

89
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,100
Well, if the answer is,
I want to create a user,

90
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,810
then you need to think a little bit.

91
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,340
Is that something that requires

92
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,800
administrative privileges or not?

93
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,370
If the answer is yes, then
you probably need to search

94
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:27,060
for the appropriate command
in section number eight.

95
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,500
So, I'm going to use man -k user again

96
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,660
and I'm using a pipe sign.

97
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,330
The pipe is taking the
output of the first command

98
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,970
and it's sending it to the second command.

99
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,570
And the second command that
I'm using here is grep.

100
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,220
No worries, we will talk
about grep separately

101
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,187
in much more detail later, but for now,

102
00:04:46,187 --> 00:04:48,340
I want to show you grep eight

103
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,890
which is going to filter
out only those lines

104
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,020
that have an eight in the text.

105
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,550
And there we go.

106
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,770
Here we have a list only of commands

107
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,530
that have been documented
in section eight of man.

108
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,240
And that includes useradd.

109
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,400
Well, probably that might
be the command that you

110
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,430
were looking for and otherwise, well,

111
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:13,430
at least the results are a
little bit easier to check

112
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,810
after the filtering.

113
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,450
So, that is how you can use man -k.

114
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,330
Man -k really is a convenient skill.

115
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:24,690
You might like having it on the RHCSA exam

116
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:27,720
because you know, on the RHCSA exam,

117
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,940
you don't have any internet access.

118
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,730
So, you need to get all
the information straight

119
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:33,750
from your system.

120
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,933
And that is why man is
so incredibly important.
