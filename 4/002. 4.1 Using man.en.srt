1
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,770
- In the last lesson,

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,770
you have learned about Linux commands.

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:13,170
Now there are so many
Linux commands available

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,730
that sometimes it's difficult

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,740
to find out how to use them.

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,390
In order to get more information

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,190
about these Linux commands,

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,390
there is man,

9
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,950
which is also a command.

10
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:23,970
And it's the best source

11
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,163
to get extensive usage information.

12
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,570
A manual of sections that
define command types.

13
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,660
And many man pages also have examples.

14
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,140
And you can search in
man pages using slash.

15
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,060
Now, man is not the only option.

16
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,310
There are other documentation solutions,

17
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,293
but you won't be using them as much.

18
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:49,350
Known for interest has full
documentation available in info.

19
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,200
And pinfo is an easy way to navigate,

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,330
much easier than info,

21
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:57,480
but you will only use
them in exceptional cases.

22
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,750
I would suggest you focus on learning man.

23
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,860
It's really important.

24
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:02,763
Let me show you.

25
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,030
All right, let me start by using man

26
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,460
on the who command, for instance.

27
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,740
That's a nice and simple
command to get started with

28
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,410
and to explore the structure of man.

29
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,030
So on the top line,

30
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,980
you can see the name of the command

31
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,693
with the section number behind it.

32
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,363
Now you might wonder,

33
00:01:23,363 --> 00:01:25,200
"Hey, if Linux is case sensitive,

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,640
then why on the top line

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,890
do we have who in uppercase?"

36
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,380
Well, that's because
of respect for history.

37
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,170
The very first man pages that were created

38
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,140
long, long time ago in the early 1970s,

39
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,080
and which by the way are kept in a museum

40
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,200
of computer history in
Mountain View, California.

41
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,000
They had this header line

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,520
on every single printed page

43
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,950
where you had the command in uppercase.

44
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,290
And that's why, out of respect for history

45
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,553
that never went away.

46
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,420
I'll tell you about these
section numbers later.

47
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,920
But section 1,

48
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,330
that is where you find commands

49
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,820
that can be used by ordinary users.

50
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,220
Now we have short
description of the command,

51
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,300
the name of the command,

52
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,720
and short explanation what it is doing.

53
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,780
The synopsis, which is
telling you how to use it.

54
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,210
In this synopsis, we
find different elements

55
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,730
that are quite, quite common.

56
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,980
Here we have the element
between square brackets,

57
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,410
that means that it is optional.

58
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,120
So you don't have to.

59
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,350
Here we have the three dots.

60
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,000
The three dots is a repeater

61
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,770
from the previous elements.

62
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,630
So you may use an option.

63
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,250
And the three dots is indicating

64
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,190
that you can even use multiple options.

65
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,520
And then we can specify
a file or arguments,

66
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,760
and well, that's between square brackets,

67
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,683
so that means it's also optional.

68
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,370
Notice the use of the pipe sign here.

69
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,880
The pipe sign is used as an or indicator.

70
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,680
So you use either a file,

71
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,900
or you use one or more arguments,

72
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,970
but you can't use both.

73
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,860
Then, and that's what's so cool about man.

74
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,970
You can see a description

75
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,410
of all these different options.

76
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,407
And in case you are wondering,

77
00:03:02,407 --> 00:03:06,120
"Hey, didn't we see them
with --help as well?"

78
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,620
Yes, you did,

79
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,540
but not as much information.

80
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,730
And that's what you use man for.

81
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:14,849
Man is giving so much information.

82
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:16,860
At the moment you are done,

83
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,720
Use Q to get out of here.

84
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,300
Now let me use man on a command

85
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,460
that has a little bit more,

86
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,420
more information,

87
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,013
like man on RPM.

88
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:30,060
RPM is a Red Hat Package Manager.

89
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,590
And there, you can see it starts

90
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,850
with the synopsis as well.

91
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,700
And this synopsis is a lot longer.

92
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,650
And you can use the Space bar

93
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,900
to scroll through the man page

94
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,970
and get to the next page.

95
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,690
And as you can see, there is a lot here.

96
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,760
Now, if man pages are big,

97
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,560
and sometimes they are,

98
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,000
then you can easily search

99
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,580
in the man page using a slash.

100
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,620
Let me use slash

101
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,490
and let me find on query for instance.

102
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,980
You can see in the lower
left corner while I'm typing.

103
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,120
And I'm typing query,

104
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,920
and it highlights the first time

105
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,580
from that current position on
where it has found the word

106
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,753
that I'm looking for.

107
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,180
If you are searching for something,

108
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,680
use N for next.

109
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,650
So you can do that as
many times as you want,

110
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,660
to see all the different query options

111
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,910
that are available.

112
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,550
I also like uppercase G in man,

113
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,950
because uppercase G brings you

114
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,560
all the way to the end of the man page,

115
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,430
where you have see also,
and sometimes even examples.

116
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,740
The see also is for related commands.

117
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,850
And the examples, well,
that is for your examples.

118
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,860
No matter how big a man page is,

119
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,030
as you can see, 730 lines in this case,

120
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,983
use Q to get out of there.

121
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:53,850
So in Linux, there are so
many commands available.

122
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:57,000
And because there are so
many commands available,

123
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,440
the documentation in man

124
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,200
is organized in different sections.

125
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,300
And for administration,

126
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,910
there are three sections that matter most.

127
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,820
Section number 1 is
for executable programs

128
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,140
or shell commands.

129
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,650
Section number 5 is for file
formats and conventions.

130
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,680
You will use it for configuration
files, for instance.

131
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,610
And section number 8 is for
system administration commands.

132
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:23,280
That's indicating that you
need a root superpowers

133
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,640
in order to use the command completely.

134
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,500
And all sections are described

135
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,090
in a man page for man,

136
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:31,350
man man.

137
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,060
And if you want an introduction

138
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,060
to what a specific section
number is all about,

139
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,310
use man followed by the section number,

140
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,960
followed by an intro.

141
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,863
Let me show you.

142
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:46,920
Okay. So we were just in man for who.

143
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,053
Oh! No manual entry for whoa.

144
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,090
Just who.

145
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,650
And here you can see who

146
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,680
with a 1 behind it,

147
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,210
in braces.

148
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,230
That's a section number.

149
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:01,593
And a section number is in
all man pages, to the top.

150
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,440
Man RPM, for instance,

151
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,260
you can see section number 8.

152
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,300
For a full description
of the section numbers,

153
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,560
use man man.

154
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,163
And you can see the
description right here.

155
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,370
For an RHCSA level,

156
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:20,160
you only care about section 1, 5, and 8.

157
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,120
But if you get deeper

158
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,950
to the Linux operating system,

159
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,090
you might get interested

160
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,980
in other sections as well.

161
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,560
Like system calls, and library calls,

162
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,280
and kernel routines, and other options.

163
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,070
Now, if you want more information

164
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,380
about what section it's doing,

165
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,110
you use man followed
by the section number.

166
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,090
And now you type the word intro.

167
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:44,340
This works for all of the sections.

168
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,810
So here you can see

169
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,663
that it's providing an
introduction to system calls.

170
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,860
Now also interesting to know is

171
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,620
if you type man passwd,

172
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,520
what's so special about passwd?

173
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,990
Well, passwd happens to be an item

174
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,630
that is documented in multiple sections.

175
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,030
So I'm typing man passwd,

176
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:08,760
and it will show me the
first that it has found.

177
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,730
And if I get out of there using Q,

178
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:12,780
then it's done.

179
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,850
If you wanna make sure
you don't miss anything,

180
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,590
type man -a.

181
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:19,950
Man -a is for all section numbers.

182
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:23,040
Here I'm in passwd section 1 again.

183
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,330
I'm pressing Q.

184
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,357
And it's telling us,

185
00:07:25,357 --> 00:07:29,610
"Hey, I found another one, passwd 1ossl.

186
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,350
Do you want to view?"

187
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,730
No, I want to skip.

188
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,110
So Control + D.

189
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:37,860
And then, I found another one, passwd 5.

190
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,693
And if you think,

191
00:07:38,693 --> 00:07:40,470
"Well, 5, that's about config files.

192
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:41,303
I like that."

193
00:07:41,303 --> 00:07:42,136
You press Enter,

194
00:07:42,136 --> 00:07:43,530
and you can see it.

195
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,030
And once you are done again,

196
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,080
you press Q.

197
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,510
And this seems to be the last one.

198
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,580
Last thing that I want
to tell you about this.

199
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,350
If there are different numbers

200
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:55,140
where your command can be documented,

201
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,630
then you can pass a
section number immediately.

202
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:00,420
So if you type man 5 passwd,

203
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:03,210
you immediately had hit section number 5.

204
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:06,153
If that is where you need to
be, can be quite convenient.
