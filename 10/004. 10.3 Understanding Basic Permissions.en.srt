00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:07,692
- In this video,

2
00:00:07,692 --> 00:00:10,980
I will give you an overview
of the basic permissions.

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,583
They are read, write and execute.

4
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,130
Now, these permissions
have different meaning

5
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,683
if applied to files or directories.

6
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,410
So if you have read on a file

7
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,950
then the result is that well,

8
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,440
how surprising you can read the file

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,753
or let's call it open the file.

10
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,083
If you have read on directories,

11
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,310
so it's a little bit different.

12
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,890
That permission allows you to list files

13
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,630
in the directory.

14
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,740
Read on the directory

15
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,740
is not about reading
files in the directory,

16
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,730
it just allows you to
read the list of files

17
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,853
that is inside the directory.

18
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,063
The other permission is write.

19
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,760
And if you have write on a file

20
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,573
and you are allowed to modify
the contents of a file.

21
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,840
Write on the directory
allows you to create

22
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,313
or to delete files.

23
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,890
It's pretty easy to understand

24
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,150
if you know that the directory

25
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,430
is really just a list of files,

26
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,680
write on the directory
allows you to modify

27
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,540
that list of files.

28
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,100
Now, we have execute on files.

29
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,810
Very important permission,

30
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,470
execute or file allows
you to run the file.

31
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,810
And execute on the directory,

32
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,300
allows you to use cd, change directory

33
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,940
to get inside the directory.

34
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,320
There's one more thing
that we need to know

35
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,880
about these permissions

36
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,810
and that is the so-called octal modes.

37
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,090
For read that will be 4.

38
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,460
For write that will be the 2.

39
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,430
And for execute that will be 1.

40
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,930
I'll tell you all about
that in just a little bit.

41
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,520
One special permission

42
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,630
that we need to talk
about is x, special X.

43
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,790
So also special about x.

44
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:11,790
When x for execute is
applied to recursively,

45
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,720
it would make directories
as well as files executable.

46
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,130
And that's not good

47
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,860
because you don't want
files to become executable

48
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,450
in an uncontrolled way.

49
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,570
That should always be a
very conscious decision.

50
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:28,260
Now, in recursive commands,
you should use uppercase X.

51
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,410
Instead, we call that special X.

52
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,790
If you use uppercase X,

53
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,270
then directories will be
granted the execute permissions,

54
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,260
but files will only get
the execute permission

55
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,970
if it is set already
elsewhere on the file.

56
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,440
And that's a pretty simple,

57
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,960
but good protection of your files.

58
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,130
To avoid that they will become
executable unexpectedly.

59
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,090
In an next video,

60
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,983
I'll show you how to set permissions.
