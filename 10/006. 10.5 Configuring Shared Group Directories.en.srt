00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,010
- In this video, I want to tell you

2
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,233
how to configure shared group directories.

3
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,630
So what is the thing?

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,240
Well, if members of the same
group need to share files

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,380
within a directory, some special
permissions are required.

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,130
The shared group ID
permission, also known as SGID,

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,130
ensures that all files created
in the shared group directory

8
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,670
are group owned by the group
owner of the directory.

9
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,250
The sticky bit permission
ensures that only the user

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,560
who is either owner of the file

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,620
or of the directory
that contains the file,

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,183
is allowed to delete the file.

13
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:42,750
So how does it work?

14
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,750
Well, we have chmod g+s,
which will apply SGID,

15
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,200
or chmod +T, which assigns sticky bit.

16
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,180
And if you want to use absolute mode

17
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,920
of four digit number is used,

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,850
of which the first digit is
for the special permissions,

19
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,170
as in chmod 3770, which will grants SGID

20
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,980
and sticky bit, as well
as rwx for user and group.

21
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:08,813
Let me show you.

22
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,850
All right, so I want to show you

23
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,450
what's going on, LS
minus L, what do we have?

24
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,970
We have these profs and these students

25
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:25,023
so we should be working
with the profs directory.

26
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,280
So if I use ID on user Anna,

27
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,300
we can see user Anna is a member of profs

28
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:38,300
and likewise for Audrey,
also a member of profs.

29
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,390
So I am going to open a shell as user Anna

30
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,113
and to the directory data profs.

31
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:51,000
And I am going to create
a couple of files.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,520
That should be enough, in LS minus L.

33
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,360
And what do we see?

34
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,220
We see that all of these files

35
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,060
are group owned by user Anna.

36
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,560
That's not what I wanted.

37
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,730
We need these to be group
owned by the group profs,

38
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,290
not the group Anna.

39
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,900
So what are we going to do about it?

40
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:14,190
Well, we are going to apply, set group ID.

41
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,960
Before doing that, there's another thing

42
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,520
that I want you to be aware of.

43
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,400
I'm opening a shell as user
Audrey, and if this user

44
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,880
goes to data profs, then what do we find?

45
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,530
Couple of files.

46
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,430
What do you think, is Audrey
allowed to remove files?

47
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:36,750
Well, the answer is yes,
because Audrey is a member

48
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,551
of the group profs and group profs

49
00:02:38,551 --> 00:02:40,500
has right on the directory.

50
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,600
And with right on the directory,

51
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,270
you can remove, easy like that.

52
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,630
Let's go fix it, so how do we fix?

53
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:53,630
Well simple, chmod 3770 /data/profs.

54
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,620
So right now we can see that
the permissions have changed.

55
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,760
How do we see that?

56
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,310
We see that the position
where before we had X

57
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,330
or group execute, we now
have S, lowercase S indicates

58
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,390
that we have set group ID
as well as group execute.

59
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,090
And we have uppercase D, uppercase D,

60
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,550
which is for the sticky bit.

61
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:22,050
So that means that if I am
logging in as user Anna again

62
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:27,050
and I go to that directory
and I create a new file,

63
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,670
then on this new file,

64
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:33,180
we have the group profs automatically set

65
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,010
as the group owner.

66
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:40,010
Now, how about we log
in as user Audrey again

67
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,610
and try to delete a file.

68
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:42,960
I mean, you do want to check

69
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,330
if it's working out all right, don't you?

70
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,280
So SU minus Audrey,

71
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,030
back to the data profs directory, and RM

72
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,700
minus F star and oh,

73
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,040
Audrey is getting operation not permitted.

74
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,813
And that's what sticky is doing.
