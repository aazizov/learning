00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,280
- We are now at the end of this lesson.

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,840
Let's do a lab.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,410
To start with, create a shared
group directory structure,

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,360
two directories, slash data slash profs

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,340
and slash data slash students

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,160
and make sure it meets
the following conditions.

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,280
Members of the group have
full read and write access

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,070
to their directories and others
have no permissions at all.

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,560
Next, modify default permission settings

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,690
such that normal users have a umask

11
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,270
that allows the user and
group to write, create,

12
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,920
and execute files and directories

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,800
while denying all other access to users.

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,633
Good luck.
