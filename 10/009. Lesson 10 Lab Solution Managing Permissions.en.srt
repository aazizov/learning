1
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,120
- All right, in order to do this lab,

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,590
we need to do two things.

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,170
Well in the lab, I'm
reading default permissions.

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,810
And as I read default permissions,

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,000
I think before we do
anything it's a good idea

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,923
to start with the default permissions.

7
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,700
These default permissions
should apply to all users.

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,060
So etc bashrc is what we need.

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,060
Now, if you are going
to modify etc bashrc,

10
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,860
then you need to be very careful

11
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,860
to do it in the right location.

12
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,500
In etc bashrc, we can see that umask

13
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,513
is set by some shell script.

14
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,480
Now this might be a little bit too much

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,410
to understand all the way by
yourself but I can explain.

16
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,640
If the user ID is greater than 199,

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,000
then we set umask to 002.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,970
And else, we set umask to 022.

19
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,290
What does that mean?

20
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,480
Well, effectively it
means that ordinary users

21
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,460
have the umask 002.

22
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,460
The root user has the umask 022.

23
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,700
And if I want to change
that, I can do it right here.

24
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,970
I make that umask 007.

25
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:15,450
So that ensures that any
file that the user creates

26
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,390
is a readable, writeable, and executable,

27
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,420
if that applies to the
user, as well as the group,

28
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,973
and others has no access at all.

29
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,610
So then the other part of
the lab, for this other part,

30
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:34,610
we need two directories,
mkdir -p/data/profs.

31
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:39,150
And we need mkdir -p/data for students.

32
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,080
You remember the minus P option
is creating the entire path

33
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,950
and that allows you to create
a sub directory structure,

34
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,383
even if the parent
directly does not exist.

35
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,860
Now we need to apply some changes here.

36
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,510
So if you read it,

37
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,550
create a shared group directory structure,

38
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,720
we just did that.

39
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,370
That meets the following requirements.

40
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,860
Members of the groups have
full read and write access

41
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,950
to their directories and others
have no permissions at all.

42
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,970
That's pretty simple.

43
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:10,970
Chgrp-profs on profs and
Chgrp students on students.

44
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:18,210
And let's students with an S.

45
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,340
Let's verify using ls -l.

46
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,650
We can see that the
permissions are said correctly

47
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:27,510
and now we can use chmod
770 on these directories.

48
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,340
We need to do that for students,

49
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,700
as well as for the profs directory.

50
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,120
And let's verify using ls -l

51
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,450
and there we can see that
everything is looking all right.

52
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,510
So the profs and the students
are owners of that directory.

53
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,240
Others is no business
being in that directory.

54
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,810
And in case you're wonder
about the user owner,

55
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,930
well, the user owner we really
don't care about user owner

56
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,400
because that is a root

57
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,570
and you know the root
user has access anyway.

58
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,260
So if the question was
phrased like this on the exam

59
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,890
then I would say, if they don't
ask anything about the user

60
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,870
just don't touch it, keep it as it is,

61
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,713
it'll be good.
