00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,180
- In this video, I'll
tell you about ownership.

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,330
Ownership is very important
in Linux permissions.

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,940
And that is because
ownership is the first thing

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,180
to determine which permissions a user has.

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,700
Every file has a user-owner, a group-owner

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,410
and the others entity,

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,570
that is also granted permissions.

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,550
We refer to that as ugo.

9
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,130
Ugo for user group and others.

10
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,530
Linux permissions are not additive.

11
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:32,490
If you're the owner,

12
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,560
permissions are applied and that's all.

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,140
So, when you are the owner,

14
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,630
nobody looks at the
permissions that you got

15
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,733
from possible group membership.

16
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,660
You can use ls-l to
display current ownership

17
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,790
and associated permissions.

18
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,130
And as the best practice,

19
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,960
if you are going to set permissions,

20
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,430
first set ownership.

21
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,440
And then you modify permissions.

22
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,300
That makes it easier to keep the overview

23
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,400
of what you are doing.
