00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,680

To work successfully with permissions,

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,820
you'll first need to
understand file ownership

so that is what we are starting with.

00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,560
Next, you'll learn how to
work with basic permissions

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,050
as well as how to set default permissions.

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,390
You'll also learn about
special permissions.

10
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:28,830
And at the end of this lesson,
