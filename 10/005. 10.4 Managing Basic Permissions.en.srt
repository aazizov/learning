00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,710
- In this video, I'll show you

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,900
how to manage basic permissions.

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,450
First, let's have a look at the commands.

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,030
So we have chmod, for change mode,

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,520
change mode is used to manage permissions.

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,140
No matter which permissions,

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,260
chmod is always what you are going to use

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,660
and you can use it in either the absolute

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,610
or the relative mode.

10
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,280
In the absolute mode, you use digits

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,650
to refer to the permissions
you want to set.

12
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,249
So chmod 750 on myfile.

13
00:00:35,249 --> 00:00:38,880
In the 750, the seven relates to the user,

14
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,420
the five relates to the
group and the zero to others.

15
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,470
Now seven, seven is
four plus two plus one,

16
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:49,596
which means that user is
getting read, write and execute.

17
00:00:49,596 --> 00:00:52,440
Group has five, that's four plus one.

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,443
So group has read and execute
and others has nothing.

19
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,050
There's also the relative mode

20
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,594
and the relative mode is convenient

21
00:00:59,594 --> 00:01:03,840
if you want to apply an
individual permission to file.

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,043
Let's go check this out.

23
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,483
All right.

24
00:01:08,483 --> 00:01:10,920
So let's get back to
the permission settings.

25
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,900
We have this new files directory.

26
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,270
Now, what do we see on
the new files directory?

27
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,080
We see that the owner has seven

28
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,390
and group others have five, five.

29
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,920
I don't like that very much.

30
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,020
So the easiest way to change it is

31
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,163
by using chmod 750 on new files.

32
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,400
So that was easy.

33
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,887
Now, if you want to
change that, you can use

34
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:39,887
chmod followed by G+W on new files.

35
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,650
And the result is that at this point,

36
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,200
the group also has the right permission.

37
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,590
And the chmod command,
I have used G plus W,

38
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,170
you can probably guess
what the possibilities are.

39
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,850
U, G and O, as I said, UGO,
for user group and others.

40
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:01,110
So if I would do chmod O+W for instance,

41
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,760
not that that makes sense,

42
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,620
there we can see that
others has right permissions

43
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,270
but that's not a good idea.

44
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:14,270
So let me do chmod O minus
W on new files as well.

45
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,620
Right, there's one more thing
that I want to show you.

46
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,110
So let's go check it out.

47
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:27,110
We have this user, and let's
do this for user Linda.

48
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,170
Okay, let me show you
the current permissions.

49
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,270
LS minus LD dot.

50
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,540
These are the permissions on
user Linda home directory.

51
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,050
Only user Linda has permissions
on the home directory.

52
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,460
Nobody else.

53
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,503
I am going to use touch rootfile.

54
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,170
Why can I do that?

55
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,990
Well, that's because
I'm doing it as a root

56
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,700
and a root is living in a world

57
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,860
where permissions don't apply.

58
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,950
Permissions are for ordinary
users, not for root.

59
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,890
Here we can see that the
root file has been created.

60
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,207
Now the interesting
thing, if I open a file

61
00:03:02,468 --> 00:03:05,400
as user Linda, and I check
in my current home directory,

62
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,960
I can see this file.

63
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,530
Now, the question is, is
this command going to work?

64
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,040
So can user Linda remove
this file, yes or no?

65
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,010
You have any idea, let's check it out.

66
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:20,940
She can, and I bet you
are surprised about it,

67
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,980
because on a rootfile, you can see

68
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,640
that well root is owner,
root is group owner

69
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,220
and others has agreed permissions only.

70
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,260
That may be correct, but don't forget

71
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,790
that deleting a file

72
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,610
requires right permissions
on the directory.

73
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,560
This is Linda's home directory

74
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,770
and on the home directory,
user Linda has read,

75
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:44,673
write and execute, so she can
delete anything she wants.
