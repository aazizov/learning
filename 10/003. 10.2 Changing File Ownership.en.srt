00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,100
- In this video, I will tell you

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,200
how to change file ownership.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,130
It's pretty simple.

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,552
There are two commands involved.

5
00:00:12,552 --> 00:00:13,385
First command is chown,

6
00:00:13,385 --> 00:00:15,000
First command is chown,

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,950
for change owner.

8
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,780
Chown needs a username

9
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,480
and optionally can use
a group name as well.

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,310
And next it needs a file name.

11
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,710
And that allows you to set the ownership.

12
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,868
C H G R P is what you do
to set group ownership

13
00:00:29,868 --> 00:00:33,570
but you can also use chown
to set user ownership as well

14
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:34,710
as group ownership.

15
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:35,543
Let me show you.

16
00:00:38,757 --> 00:00:39,930
So to demonstrate this

17
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,090
I'm going to create a directory.

18
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,313
Let's call it data new files.

19
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,510
I'm creating this
directory as the root user.

20
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,450
If I type ID, always a convenient command

21
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,010
If you work with permissions,

22
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,500
then you can see my
current user ID is zero.

23
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,100
My current group ID is zero as well.

24
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,380
Because of these current settings

25
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,473
the ownership will be set accordingly.

26
00:01:03,473 --> 00:01:06,765
So as you can see new files as user root

27
00:01:06,765 --> 00:01:10,500
as the user owner group
root as the group owner.

28
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,540
And right here, starting the
second position up to the end,

29
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,730
we can see the permissions
that are currently applied.

30
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:21,180
So read, write, execute,
read, execute, read, execute,

31
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,730
which means that the user
has read write execute,

32
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:26,340
the group has read, execute and others,

33
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,060
which is everybody else, as
read and execute as well.

34
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:30,893
Now, the purpose

35
00:01:30,893 --> 00:01:35,893
of this demo is to show you
how to use chown and C H D R P.

36
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,400
So chown can be used as follows.

37
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,640
If I use chown Lisa on new files,

38
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,520
then the result is that user Lisa is now

39
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,950
user owner of the files.

40
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,050
If you change ownership
that doesn't affect the

41
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,510
permissions at all,
it's a separate setting.

42
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:54,270
So you will need to change
the permissions accordingly,

43
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,100
If that is needed.

44
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,450
Also convenient to say

45
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,230
you can use something like
chown Linda colon sales

46
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,970
on new files.

47
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,860
In which the colon is a separator

48
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,900
between the user and the group.

49
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,150
Now, if we check the current
permission assignments

50
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,250
we can see the user Linda

51
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,923
and group sales is set as a group owner.

52
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:18,420
Now, alternatively, you can use C H G R P.

53
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,490
So let me use C H G R P.

54
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,050
I don't have that many groups,

55
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,230
so let me use wheel as a group to make

56
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,820
that the group owner.

57
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,720
Notice that normally

58
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,991
you would never do that,
but I just need a group to

59
00:02:29,991 --> 00:02:33,510
make that the owner and really, I don't

60
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:36,630
like group wheel being the
owner of new files because wheel

61
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,540
should really be used
for pseudo purposes only.

62
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,530
So, you know what

63
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:45,150
let me use yet another
alternative chown colon sales

64
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,895
on new file and the result is
what you can see right here.

65
00:02:49,895 --> 00:02:51,210
on new file and the result is
what you can see right here.

66
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,250
User Linda as well as group sales

67
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,533
are owner of the directory new files.
