00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,910
- All right, we are now
at the end of this lesson.

2
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,020
Let's do a lab.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,500
This lab is about using root privileges.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,550
In order to do so,

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,740
make sure you have a user it name linda,

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,260
and create a pseudo
configuration that allows linda

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,843
to perform common administration task.

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,310
So you should allow useradd,
usermod, and use userdel,

9
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,170
and you should allow changing passwords,

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,630
but not password for user root.

11
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,620
And also, ensure that any user only needs

12
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,730
to enter a password

13
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,520
for sudo operations every 60 minutes.

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,353
Good luck.
