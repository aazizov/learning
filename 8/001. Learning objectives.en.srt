00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,060
- Hello, and welcome to lesson eight.

2
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:09,893
In this lesson,

3
00:00:09,893 --> 00:00:12,360
you'll learn how to use
your root Privileges.

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,450
First, I'll explain what
exactly the root User is.

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,670
And after that, you'll
learn how to use su,

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,260
to switch user accounts.

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,620
Which is a convenient skill
when working with Linux.

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,600
Then I will tell you how to use sudo

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,850
and how to manage sudo Configuration.

10
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,100
And next you learn how
to use secure shell.

11
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,760
Or ssh, to log into systems remotely.

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,180
At the end of this lesson,

13
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,630
you'll find the lab, as
well as the lab solution.
