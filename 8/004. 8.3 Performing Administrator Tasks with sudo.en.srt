00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,390
- In this video, I will
tell you about sudo.

2
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,700
So sudo is a much more secure mechanism

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,743
to perform administrative tasks.

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:19,770
Behind sudo is the /etc/sudoers
configuration file.

5
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,040
And while editing
/etc/sudoers through visudo,

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,940
very detailed administrator
privileges can be assigned.

7
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,820
In SU it's all or nothing,
you're in a root shell

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,960
or you're not.

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,870
In sudo it is possible to assign

10
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,020
this one or two commands to
a user that can be performed

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,783
at administrative
privileges and nothing else.

12
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,170
Now, if a user has sudo privileges,

13
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,780
to learn an administration task using sudo

14
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,200
the user needs to type sudo
followed by the command.

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,690
And that will prompt for
the current user password.

16
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:52,860
And it'll run the command

17
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,140
if this is allowed through etc/sudoers

18
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,830
and if not it'll print
a fine error message.

19
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:03,030
To open a root shell, sudo-i can be used.

20
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,030
Now let me show you.

21
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,730
Now let's look at this.

22
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,500
I'm in a shell as user Anna

23
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,590
and I'm using sudo LS/root.

24
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,630
That's a test that I like a lot.

25
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,790
It's non intrusive, not dangerous at all,

26
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,710
but it proves if it is working.

27
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,810
Here, we can see what's happening

28
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,370
when a user is typing sudo.

29
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,620
User needs to prompt
password, so here we go.

30
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,880
Password for user Anna

31
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,420
and Anna is not in the sudo as well.

32
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,850
The incident will be reported.

33
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,400
That is what is so secure about sudo.

34
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,100
Now, if I exit and exit again,

35
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,930
to get back in my student shell,

36
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,380
and I do the same sudo LS/root

37
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,140
then we can see that it is working.

38
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,496
And that is

39
00:01:47,496 --> 00:01:50,160
because the student user
is the administrative user.

40
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,200
The first user that you have created

41
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,970
after installing of your system

42
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,765
will always have sudo privileges.

43
00:01:56,765 --> 00:02:00,810
And this already demonstrates why sudo

44
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,940
is much better than SU

45
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:05,100
for performing administration task.

46
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,350
But there's so much more
that you can do with sudo.

47
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,700
In the next video, I'll
tell you more about it.
