1
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,720
- The su command is used
to switch user accounts

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,073
from a shell environment.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,300
And you can use the su
command with a - option,

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,850
which allows you to load
the complete environment

5
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,200
of the target user as well.

6
00:00:20,155 --> 00:00:21,960
And while using su, the password

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,270
of the target user is entered.

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,190
And if the root user has a password

9
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,493
you can use su - or su on a root as well.

10
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,790
Using su - to open a root shell

11
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,843
is considered bad practice
however, use sudo -i instead.

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,370
The main benefit of sudo -i
is that nobody has to know

13
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,390
the the root password, and
it's for authorized uses only,

14
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,460
that makes it more secure.

15
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,489
What is convenient about su,

16
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:53,790
is that you can also use it for
testing other user accounts.

17
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,890
And that is something that
we are going to do a lot

18
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,110
in the next couple of lessons.

19
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,150
As administrator, you create a user,

20
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:03,450
you assign some permission,
you wanna test use su -

21
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,690
to figure out if it works out as expected.

22
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:07,923
Let's do a quick demo.

23
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,610
So here I am in a shell
as my ordinary user

24
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:19,320
I'm using su - anna, it's
prompting for a password.

25
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,910
Whose password would that be?

26
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,650
Password of the target user,

27
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,520
su is always prompting for the
password of the target user.

28
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,400
That means that if you
are an ordinary user

29
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,050
and you want to use su a lot,

30
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,183
you need to know lots of passwords.

31
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,810
But at this moment I have a subshell

32
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,170
and in that subshell and
whoami is going to prove it,

33
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,540
my user identity is Anna.

34
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,600
Using exit to get back
to the student shell,

35
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,250
and then we are all done.

36
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,730
Now if I use su - as mentioned,

37
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,910
it's always recommended
to use a minus with su.

38
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,680
It's prompting for a password, again,

39
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,140
this time the password of the root user.

40
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,333
As you can see I'm in a root shell.

41
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,520
Now the fun thing is that
user root can su into anybody.

42
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,160
So if root would use su - anna,

43
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,530
root is not prompted
for a password at all.

44
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,170
And that is what makes su convenient.

45
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,300
If you have administrative privileges

46
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,280
and you want to test access rights

47
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,893
for specifics users this is the way to go.
