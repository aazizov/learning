1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,060
- Before we can talk
about root privileges.

2
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,760
We need to understand the root user.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,800
Since the earliest days of UNIX,

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,500
a user account with UID 0 existed

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,543
to perform administration tasks.

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,520
And on Linux, this user by
default has the name root.

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,470
The special thing about
a root user is that

8
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,750
the root user operates in kernel space.

9
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,850
And for that reason has unlimited access

10
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,340
to all parts of the system.

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,400
We call root also the unrestricted user

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,080
or the privileged user.

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,570
There are no limitations
in the original design

14
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,333
of the UNIX operating
system for the root user.

15
00:00:44,237 --> 00:00:46,050
Now, RHEL 9, it's up to you

16
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,540
to define what you want to do with root.

17
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:52,080
You can decide whether or
not to activate this user.

18
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,420
And if the user root is not activated

19
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,633
the administrative user is
used for administration access.

20
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,660
And this administrative user is the user

21
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,370
that you need to create.

22
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:03,780
While installing RHEL 9,

23
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,520
if you don't have a root user,

24
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,220
'cause otherwise your
system would be unmanageable

25
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,220
and that's not good.

26
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,330
If you want to activate the root user,

27
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,220
you just have to set a password.

28
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,320
We have seen that while installing RHEL 9.

29
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,140
But from a security perspective,

30
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,550
it may be a good idea not

31
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,533
to have an active root user at all.

32
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:24,930
Additional measures are possible

33
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,080
to restrict the root user
access to the system.

34
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,130
For instance, also during the
installation, you can decide

35
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,610
whether or not the root user
is allowed to use secure shell

36
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,250
or SSH to connect to a server.

37
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,110
And I can tell you by default

38
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,393
the root user cannot RHEL 9.
