1
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,420
- All right, so here we
have the lab solution.

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,770
I'm going to continue a bit

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,840
on what we have already
done for user linda.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,840
So sudo vim on /etc/sudoers.d/linda

5
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,590
where we have ALL=/usr/bin/passwd
not usr/bin/passwd root,

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,733
and let's just include these
other commands as well.

7
00:00:30,932 --> 00:00:35,932
/usr/sbin/useradd, and /usr/sbin/usermod,

8
00:00:37,443 --> 00:00:42,343
and /usr/sbin/userdel.

9
00:00:42,343 --> 00:00:46,170
(computer keyboard clacking)

10
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,620
So that should do it for
the part of user linda.

11
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,907
Now, I also wanna do a sudo visudo.

12
00:00:54,702 --> 00:00:56,430
This visudo is very convenient

13
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,980
because it's a default
sudo configuration file

14
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,110
and it contains nice examples.

15
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,700
Go all the way down,

16
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,170
and if you go all the way down,

17
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,580
you see some example lines

18
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,903
like this one right here,

19
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,380
which is, oh boy, very bad line.

20
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,880
Same thing without the password.

21
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,080
Honestly, I don't get it,

22
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,360
why they keep it as an example by default.

23
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,650
It's like inviting people,

24
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,477
like, "Hey, you wanna do
something very stupid? Go ahead.

25
00:01:22,477 --> 00:01:25,950
"You only have to remove
the comment line from it."

26
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,893
So let's just clean that up.

27
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,470
I like this one as well

28
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,660
because this one is giving you an example

29
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,370
of what we need to do for user linda,

30
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,440
in case you don't remember it.

31
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,690
And you know on your RHCSA exam,

32
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:43,440
it's so useful if you can
find examples like this.

33
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,433
And I am going to put in generic defaults.

34
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,297
time stamp_type is global,

35
00:01:51,297 --> 00:01:54,990
(computer keyboard clacking)

36
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,403
and timeout is, well,
what do you want it to be?

37
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,623
Let's do 60, 60 sounds
reasonable, and let's save this.

38
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,160
And uh-oh! What do we see?

39
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,940
We see we did something invalid,

40
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,730
and that's what good about visudo.

41
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,080
So it's asking what now?

42
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,690
I'm pressing enter because
I wanna know my choices.

43
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:22,800
I am going to edit my sudoers file again,

44
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,020
and that is bringing me to the line

45
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,610
that contains the problem,

46
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:31,203
and the problem is that
we need timestamp_timeout.

47
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,040
You could have guessed
that because just timeout,

48
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,480
what is just timeout?

49
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,370
It's a timestamp_timeout.

50
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,140
Now I'm saving the changes again,

51
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,290
and now you can see that sudo is happy.

52
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:48,290
So once more, su - linda to
open a shell as user Linda.

53
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,863
and as user linda I'm
using sudo useradd bob.

54
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,290
And of course it's prompting

55
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,300
for the password for user Linda,

56
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,730
and well, it's not
complaining about anything,

57
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:03,040
so that seems to be happening all right.

58
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,640
Sudo passwd bob, that's still allowed.

59
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,350
Still allowed, and Bob is
getting a password right now.

60
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,633
And that's all you needed
to do for this lab.
